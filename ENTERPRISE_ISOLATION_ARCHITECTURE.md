# Enterprise Customer Isolation Architecture
**Platform:** Sentinel GRC Enterprise Compliance Platform  
**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Status:** Architecture Design Complete

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the enterprise-grade customer isolation architecture for Sentinel GRC, addressing the PDF processing limitations while establishing a premium pricing model through complete data isolation and AI-powered compliance intelligence.

## üéØ Problem Solved

### Immediate Issue: PDF Processing Limitation
- **Problem:** API limit of 100 pages per request blocking ISO27001 report generation
- **Solution:** Three-tier approach:
  1. **Batch Processing** (Immediate): Process PDFs in 95-page batches
  2. **Local Extraction** (Short-term): Extract text locally, no API limits
  3. **RAG Architecture** (Long-term): Vector database with semantic search

### Strategic Opportunity: Premium Enterprise Offering
- **Market Gap:** Most GRC platforms use shared infrastructure
- **Our Solution:** Complete customer isolation with dedicated resources
- **Value Proposition:** Data sovereignty + AI intelligence = 3-5x pricing

    - Separate audit trails
    - SIEM integration
```

### RAG Architecture for Compliance
```python
Pipeline:
  1. Ingestion:
     - Extract text from PDFs locally (no limits)
     - Chunk with 1000 token segments
     - Generate embeddings
     
  2. Storage:
     - Vector database (Weaviate/Pinecone)
     - Metadata in PostgreSQL
     - Original docs in S3
     
  3. Retrieval:
     - Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
     - Reranking with cross-encoder
     - Context window optimization
     
  4. Generation:
     - GPT-4 for Enterprise tier
     - Claude-3 as fallback
     - Custom fine-tuned models for Premium
```

## üí∞ Business Case

### Cost Structure
```yaml
Standard Tier:
  Infrastructure: $500/month
  Margin: 60%
  Annual Revenue: $15-25K
  
Enterprise Tier:
  Infrastructure: $2,500/month
  Margin: 70%
  Annual Revenue: $75-150K
  
Premium Tier:
  Infrastructure: $5,000/month
  Services: $3,000/month
  Margin: 60%
  Annual Revenue: $150-300K
```

### Market Validation
- **Competitors:** Archer RSA, ServiceNow, MetricStream all offer isolated instances
- **Demand:** 67% of enterprises require data isolation (Gartner)
- **Premium Justified:** GDPR fines average $1.2M, data breach costs $4.45M

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [x] Batch PDF processor implementation
- [x] RAG architecture design
- [ ] Test with Brunel ISO27001 documents
- [ ] Deploy to development environment

### Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement customer isolation in Kubernetes
- [ ] Set up dedicated PostgreSQL instances
- [ ] Configure Weaviate vector database
- [ ] Implement zero-trust networking

### Phase 3: Go-to-Market (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Create pricing calculator
- [ ] Build demo environment for each tier
- [ ] Generate case studies
- [ ] Launch sales enablement

## üìà Competitive Advantages

### Why We Win
1. **Intelligence Layer:** Neo4j knowledge graph provides insights competitors lack
2. **True Isolation:** Not just logical separation but physical isolation
3. **Flexible Deployment:** Cloud, on-prem, or hybrid

   python src/architecture/customer_isolated_rag_architecture.py
   ```

3. **Generate Enterprise Proposal**
   ```python
   proposal = generate_customer_proposal(
       company_name="Target Enterprise",
       employees=500,
       industry="healthcare",
       requirements=["HIPAA", "SOC2"]
   )
   ```

## üí° Conclusion

The customer isolation architecture transforms Sentinel GRC from a commodity compliance tool into a premium enterprise platform. By solving the immediate PDF processing limitation through intelligent batching and RAG architecture, while simultaneously building true data isolation, we justify 3-5x pricing versus competitors.

**The path forward is clear:**
1. Implement batch processing (today)
2. Deploy RAG architecture (this week)
3. Build customer isolation (next sprint)
4. Launch enterprise sales (within 30 days)

This architecture positions Sentinel GRC as the premium choice for enterprises serious about compliance, data sovereignty, and AI-powered intelligence.
