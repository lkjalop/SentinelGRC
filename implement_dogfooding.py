DEMO TALKING POINTS: RECURSIVE VALIDATION
==========================================

"What you're seeing here isn't a fake demo with sample data. 
This is our actual compliance dashboard for Sentinel GRC itself.

We use our own platform to maintain SOC 2 compliance for building 
the platform. Every feature you see has been battle-tested on our 
own compliance requirements.

Key Points to Highlight:

1. REAL DATA: 
   - "This shows our actual compliance score: 87%"
   - "These are real controls we've implemented for our own platform"
   - "This evidence comes from our actual GitHub repository"

2. RECURSIVE VALIDATION:
   - "We found 4 gaps in our own compliance while building this"
   - "Each gap became a feature improvement"
   - "We catch issues in development, not during audits"

3. CREDIBILITY:
   - "We trust this platform enough to use it for our own compliance"
   - "Our upcoming SOC 2 audit uses evidence generated by this system"
   - "If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for you"

4. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
   - "Our competitors demo with fake data"
   - "We demo with real compliance data from real use"
   - "You're not buying a tool, you're buying proven methodology"

POWER CLOSE:
"The confidence you see in this platform comes from the fact that 
our own business depends on it working correctly. We're not just 
selling you software - we're sharing the exact system that keeps 
us compliant."
