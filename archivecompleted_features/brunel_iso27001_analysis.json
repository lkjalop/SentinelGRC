Purpose of Document\nThe purpose of this document is to define roles and responsibilities that are essential to the\nimplementation of the University\u2019s Information Security Management System (ISMS) and\nInformation Security (INFOSEC) Policy.\nPlease refer to Brunel University London ISMS Document BUL-GLOS-000 - SyOPs Glossary of\nTerms for the glossary of terms, acronyms and their definitions for the suite of Brunel\nUniversity (BUL) London ISMS documentations.\nThe University\u2019s Information Security Policy states that:\n\u201cBrunel University London will maintain an Information Security Management\nSystem (ISMS) to preserve its competitive edge, educational excellence, cash-flow,\ndata protection, customer confidence and reputational image.\nBrunel University will ensure that the individuals, roles, bodies and governing\nframeworks are in place to maintain security ownership and responsibilities.\u201d\nThis document formally establishes these governing bodies and roles and responsibilities for\nthe University Information Security management and the ISMS framework. An\norganisational schematic is at Annex A.\n2. ISO 27001 - Conformance\nThis section indicates the University Conformance to ISO27001:2013.\nUniversity ISMS Control SOA \u2013 Number A.6 \u2013 Organisation of Information Security\nNumber\nISO 27001:2013 Information Classification Objective\nConformance Control A.6.1.1 Information Security Roles and Responsibilities\n3. Principles\nFrom ISO 27001 & ISO 270141, the principles of information security governance are to:\n\uf0b7 Establish an organisational wide information security policy.\n\uf0b7 Adopt a risk based approach.\n\uf0b7 Set the direction of investment for INFOSEC.\n\uf0b7 Ensure conformance with security requirements.\n\uf0b7 Foster a security-positive environment.\n\uf0b7 Review performance in relation to business outcomes.\n1 Information Security Governance\nPROTECT Page 4 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.1\nIssue No: 1\nIssue Date: 09/08/17\nPage: 5 of 15\n\uf0b7 The organisation should define accountabilities and responsibilities at a high level,\nmaking top management explicitly accountable for information security but ensuring\nthat personal roles and responsibilities are also defined.\nWithin BUL, information security governance has been approached holistically and covers\npeople, processes and technology \u2013 it is not an IT issue. The security controls that form part\nof the ISMS take account of human, environmental and physical factors and cover information\nin all its forms including paper records. The BUL information security governance framework\nencompasses policies, processes, procedures, tools and training that are all joined up and\ndesigned in relation to each other in order to achieve BUL information security objectives.\n4. Committees and Governance\nCouncil\nCouncil has ultimate accountability for information security activities within the University.\nMore specifically, it protects institutional reputation by being assured that clear regulations,\npolicies and procedures that adhere to legislative and regulatory requirements are in place,\nethical in nature, and followed. Council needs to be assured that there are effective systems\nof control and risk management, and that governance structures and processes are fit for\npurpose by referencing them against recognised standards of good practice.\nExecutive Board\nThe University Executive Board is responsible via the Vice-Chancellor to Council for:\n\uf0b7 Leading and fostering a culture that values, protects and uses information for the\nsuccess of the University and benefit of its members.\n\uf0b7 Defining the University\u2019s information security risk appetite in the context of the\nprevailing legal, political, socio-economic and technological environment and external\nstandards.\n\uf0b7 Ensuring that a fit for purpose and adequately resourced information security\nframework is in place including this policy document as a reference document.\nThe Executive Board is ultimately accountable for information security governance and\nINFOSEC risk as a whole. The management and control of information security risks is an\nintegral part of Executive Board governance. The Executive Board provides overall strategic\ndirection by approving and mandating the information security principles and axioms but\ndelegates operational responsibilities for physical and information security to the COO, CIO\nand CISO.\nPROTECT Page 5 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.1\nIssue No: 1\nIssue Date: 09/08/17\nPage: 6 of 15\nThe Executive Board is responsible for achieving the Cyber & INFOSEC vision set out in the\nStrategy paper2 and ensuring the appropriate levels of investment are made to meet the\ndesired goals of the Cyber & INFOSEC Strategy.\nInfrastructure Strategy Committee\nThe Infrastructure Strategy Committee (ISC) is a forum for operational and executive\nconsideration of University-wide digital and information services strategy. This and its\ninformation subcommittee have specific oversight responsibilities related to\nimplementation of the Information Security Policy and ISMS security controls including the\nfollowing:\n\uf0b7 Approving and reviewing the Cyber & INFOSEC strategy to ensure the implementation of\nthe Information Security Policy and associated ISMS.\n\uf0b7 Analysing the business impact of proposed Cyber & INFOSEC strategies on the\nUniversity.\n\uf0b7 Approving proposed policies of the ISMS.\n\uf0b7 Serving as the executive champion for accepted strategies and policies within respective\nbusiness units and colleges.\nCyber and Information Security and Applications Steering Group (CISA)\nThe Cyber, Information Security and Applications Steering Group purpose is to drive the\nprogramme of Cyber & INFOSEC strategic projects forward and deliver the capability\ndevelopment outcomes and benefits as set out in the Cyber & INFOSEC strategy paper.

This is usually the most\nsenior officer in a Directorate or College division. Some examples of Data Owners include the Registrar and student data; The CFO for financial data; & the\nHR Director for employee data. Within colleges this role will fall to the Director of College Operations or the Institute Director of Operations for research. In\nmost cases, the Data Custodian is not the Data Owner.\nData Custodians are IT services and / or locally appointed persons responsible for the technical environments. A system administrator or Data Custodian is a\nperson who has technical control over an information asset dataset. Usually, this person has the administrator or root account or equivalent level of\naccess. This is a critical role and it must be executed in accordance with the access guidelines developed by the Data Owner.\nData Users also have a critical role to protect and maintain BUL information systems and data. For the purpose of information security, a Data User is any\nemployee, contractor or third-party provider who is authorised by the Data Owner to access information assets.\nGeneral Responsibilities of the Data Owner\n1. Ensure compliance with BUL policies and all regulatory requirements as they relate to the information asset.\n2. Assign an appropriate classification to information assets. BUL has three classifications of information assets:\n\uf0b7 University Confidential\n\uf0b7 Protect\n\uf0b7 Unclassified\nPROTECT Page 13 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.1\nIssue No: 1\nIssue Date: 09/08/17\nPage: 14 of 15\n3. Determine appropriate criteria for obtaining access to information assets. A Data Owner is accountable for who has access to information assets within\ntheir functional areas. A Data Owner may decide to review and authorised each access request individually or may define a set of rules that determine who\nis eligible for access based on business function, support role, etc. Access must be granted based on the principles of least privilege as well as separation of\nduties.\n4. Bi-annually, the Data Owner is also responsible for reviewing who has been given access to ensure accuracy. University audits of information assets will\ntake place annually as part of the ISMS.\n5. Ensuring that Data Custodians implement reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\nUniversity Data.\nBUL has published guidance on implementing reasonable and appropriate security controls based on three classifications of data: Unclassified, Protect and\nUniversity Confidential. See the BUL-POL-8.2 Information Classification for more information. Data owners will often have their own security requirements\nspecified in contractual language and/or based on various industry standards. Data owners should be familiar with their own unique requirements and\nensure Data Custodians are also aware of and can demonstrate compliance with these requirements. The Cyber and Information Security Manager can\nassist with mapping controls identified in the BUL-PROC-8.02 Information Classification to controls mandated by contract(s) or industry standards.\nGeneral Responsibilities of the Data Custodian\n1. Assign and remove access to others based upon the direction of the Data Owner.\nAssigning access to the information asset dataset so others can perform their respective job functions is an important and necessary part of the Data\nCustodian\u2019s job.\n2. Produce reports or derivative information for others. In many cases the Data Custodian is also responsible for producing, interpreting, and distributing\ninformation based on the datasets to which he or she has access.\n3. Log all information provided and access granted to others. A log of all information that is disseminated must be kept including the dataset used, the\nreceiving party, and the date. Likewise, access granted to others must be logged including the access level granted and the dataset in question.\nPROTECT Page 14 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.1\nIssue No: 1\nIssue Date: 09/08/17\nPage: 15 of 15\n4. Implement appropriate physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset dataset. Data\nCustodians are expected to work with Data Owners to gain a better understanding of these requirements. Security controls must be documented and shared\nwith the Data Owner.\nPROTECT Page 15 of 15"

The demand for remote\ninstant access to the virtual office regardless of location or time of day via the use of portable\nelectronic devices which can offer the traveller both communications services and secure\naccess to University critical data is increasing exponentially.\nDevices such smart phones, laptops and tablets can all be secured, but the person operating\nthem, and indeed accessing data remotely, must be made aware of the associated risks they\nface whilst travelling on international business and to follow this policy and guidelines to\nmitigate the risk.\nStaff and students who are travelling internationally on University business must be familiar with\nwhat measures they can take to limit the potential for threats to expose vulnerabilities and\ncreate risk, they also need to understand that the very measures designed to protect them, can\nalso bring about unforeseen challenges when crossing international borders.\nThis advice can be found within the Travel Booking system that the University provides to\narrange all travel and accommodation in relation to University business (Ian Allen Travel) or\nfrom Terry Vaas, Head of Security And Emergency Planning\nFor example, such is the risk of compromise in some high cyber risk countries that an\nexpectation exists whereby any devices taken into the country will be accessed remotely and\nunencrypted data copied as a norm. This makes it essential that international travellers are fully\nbriefed regarding ICT entry requirements into each country, particularly those assessed as high\nICT risk (including Bahrain, China and Russia) and that they are provided with the necessary\ntraining to understand what mitigation measures should be implemented before travel.\nHowever, there are also instances where the measures deployed by border security agents in\nwestern countries have also placed sensitive corporate data at risk, and this is something which\nthe traveller cannot control or mitigate against.\nRecommendations:.\n\u2022 Always take \u2018clean\u2019 equipment where possible. The University offers clean loan laptops\nfor travel, loaded only with what is needed for that business trip. Any University\nConfidential information can then be accessed over the internet once arrived at the\ndestination and deleted before returning.\n\u2022 Follow University encryption guidelines - BUL-POL-10.1 - Cryptographic Policy. University\nresearch data can be subject to suspicion if academics and students undertake their\nresearch abroad.\n\u2022 Ensure you are aware of the rules surrounding encryption, and the legality of entering a\ncountry with an encrypted device.\n\u2022 Password protect all devices using strong complex password layers and ensure that both\nUniversity and personal devices are protected, where possible, by a multi-factor\nauthentication process.\nProtect Page 11 of 20\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.2.1\nIssue No: 5\nIssue Date: 06/05/2020\nPage: 12 of 20\n\u2022 Disable remote connectivity such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and file sharing when not in use,\nand always decline to allow others to connect a USB or portable device to any equipment\nbut especially a laptop or mobile phone.\n\u2022 Plan ahead \u2013 understand that there is a possibility you may be questioned by customs\nofficials. Carrying a headed letter in the local language stating that your equipment uses\ncommercial encryption software and that the information is normal business information in\nrelation to your role, might prove to be useful if you do face questioning at a border.\n\u2022 Never use USB drives or software received as gifts or promotional items until they have\nbeen verified clean by the University IS department.\n\u2022 Backup important data that will travel with you.\n\u2022 Assume all internet connections as insecure and use a VPN at all times.\n\u2022 Do not plug your device into USB charger kiosks in airports, hotels or other public places1. These\nmay be infected with malware that will be uploaded to your device that may result in your device\nbeing compromised and data being stolen.\n\u2022 Disable remote connectivity such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and file sharing where possible.\n\u2022 Do not leave devices unattended. Even hotel safes should not be considered secure.\n1 If using a USB Data Blocker then charge points may be used \u2013 A USB Data Blocker will eliminate the risk of\ninfecting your phone or tablet with malware, and even prevent criminals installer/executing any malicious code that\nenables access your data.\nProtect Page 12 of 20\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.2.1\nIssue No: 5\nIssue Date: 06/05/2020\nPage: 12 of 20\nRussia / Other risky\nUSA EU ROW\nChina / Iran countries\n(1)\nThreat\nTheft of Data \uf061\uf020 \uf020 \uf020 \uf020 \uf061\uf020\nAcquisition of Data \uf020 \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020\nTTPs\nSecurity checkpoint requisition - Be prepared to turn on and off\ndevices, and present all removable media for customs officials.\nYou may be asked to decrypt data for inspection at international \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020 \uf061\uf020\nborders.

Introduction\nThe Information Asset Owner (IAO) is a university mandated role, aligned to the Information\nSecurity Management System. Individuals are appointed as IAO and are responsible for\nensuring that information assets are handled and managed appropriately. This means making\nsure that information assets are properly protected and that their value to the organisation\nis fully exploited.\nAn Information Asset Owner reports to the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)1, who in\nturn reports to the Executive Board.\nThe role is a standard requirement of an ISO 27001 Information Security Management System\n(ISMS) and supports the provision of a common, consistent and unambiguous understanding\nof what information is held, how important it is, how sensitive it is, the risk to it and who is\nresponsible for it.\n2. Purpose of Document\nThis document sets out the university\u2019s approach to managing and securing its information\nand data assets. It explains the concept of an \u2018Information Asset\u2019 and defines the role of the\n\u2018Information Asset Owner\u2019 who is responsible for each Information Asset. This document also\nsets out the primary responsibilities of an Information Asset Owner for managing the risks to\npersonal data and business critical information held within a department.\nThe University\u2019s Information Security Policy states that:\n\u201cBrunel University London will maintain an Information Security Management\nSystem (ISMS) to preserve its competitive edge, educational excellence, cash-flow,\ndata protection, customer confidence and reputational image.\nBrunel University will ensure that the individuals, roles, bodies and governing\nframeworks are in place to maintain security ownership and responsibilities.\u201d\nA guiding principle of our Strategy document is that \u2018All information and systems will have\nidentified owners.\u2019 This document formally establishes the roles and responsibilities for IAO\nwithin the University Information Security Management System framework.\n3.

Background\nThe university holds a wealth of information. This information can be in different formats and\nheld in a variety of locations and systems. It is essential that the university understands the\ninformation it holds so that we can adequately manage and protect it.\nTo manage this information, the university needs to have Information Asset Registers (IAR)\nwhich are managed by Information Asset Owners. Information Asset Owners are senior\nmembers of staff who have been appointed to be responsible for one or more identified\ninformation asset(s). This person will be responsible for ensuring that the Information Asset\nis accurately stored and maintained on the Information Asset Register. The full university\nInformation Asset Register will be owned by the CIO office.\nThe IAO will provide assurance to the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) on the security\nand use of their assets. They are responsible for ensuring that specific information assets are\naccessed, handled and managed appropriately. This means making sure that information\nassets are properly protected and that their value to the organisation is fully exploited.\nPerforming the role well brings significant benefits. It provides a common, consistent and\nunambiguous understanding of what information the university holds, how important it is,\nhow sensitive it is, how accurate it is, how reliant the university is on it, and who is responsible\nfor it.\n5. Principles\nThe IAO role is about managing information not systems.\nThe driver for establishing the role of the IAO within the ISMS is to ensure that information\nassets, whether personal data or business data, are identified and securely handled. This also\ninvolves making sure that it is used in the way that is required, for as long as required.\nThe IAO is responsible for ensuring that information is protected appropriately, and where\nthe information is shared, that proper confidentiality, integrity and availability safeguards\napply and are in place.\nThe IAO role is about providing information assurance and making sure that action is taken to\nsecure information assets, its movement and sharing is appropriately managed, and that\ncontracts are in place where it is shared with 3rd parties.\nPROTECT Page 5 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 6 of 12\nAn IAO can delegate responsibility to particular areas that can support the role but the IAO\nand SIRO retain the accountability for proper information management and handling.\n6. Asset Management\nAn information asset is a body of information, defined and managed as a single unit, so that\nit can be understood, shared, protected and exploited effectively. Information assets have\nrecognisable and manageable value, risk, content and lifecycles. They include physical and\ndigital assets and are recorded in an information asset register \u2013 held centrally within the\nISMS and locally within colleges and directorates.\nThe university SIRO will decide what information assets IAO\u2019s are responsible for. This could\ncover both sensitive personal data and non-personal information that is critical to business.\nIt could be held in paper as well as electronic formats.\nWhen an IAO is appointed, performance metrics will be discussed and agreed. Some of\nthese will be directly related to the need to demonstrate compliance with mandatory\nrequirements, but others may be specific to colleges or directorates.\n7. Information Asset Register\nAn Information Asset Register (IAR) is a mechanism for understanding and managing the\nuniversity\u2019s assets and the risks to them. The IAR should include links between the\ninformation assets, their business requirements or processes and any technical\ndependencies that there may be. An IAR is dynamic and should be consistently updated and\nimproved to ensure each business unit develops a \u2018mature\u2019 understanding of the\ninformation that it holds.\nThe Cyber & INFOSEC teams have developed a standardised asset register but general\ninformation on the types of assets and how to develop the registers can be seen at Annex A.\n8. Roles and Responsibilities\nThe CIO undertakes the role of Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) for the organisation.\nThe role of the SIRO is to take ownership of the organisation's information risk, act as an\nadvocate for information risk on the executive board and provide advice to the board and\ncouncil on the Information risk governance and risk exposure. The SIRO\u2019s responsibilities\ncan be summarised as:\n\uf0b7 Leading and fostering a culture that values, protects and uses information for the\nsuccess of the organisation and benefit of its clients and stakeholders.\n\uf0b7 Owning the organisation\u2019s overall information risk policy and risk assessment processes\nand ensuring they are implemented consistently.\nPROTECT Page 6 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 7 of 12\n\uf0b7 Advising the VC & COO or relevant accounting officer on the information risk aspects of\ninternal controls.\nInformation Asset Owners\nInformation Asset Owners (IAOs) are Directors and Heads of Departments responsible for\nthe protection of particular Information Assets2. IAOs may delegate information security\ntasks to managers or other individuals but remain accountable for the proper\nimplementation of the tasks.\nThe IAO is expected to understand the overall business goals of the university and how the\ninformation assets they own contribute to and affect these goals. The IAO should nominate\nat least one Information Lead to support the IAO on a day-to-date basis.\nIAOs are responsible for:\n\uf0b7 Leading and fostering a culture that values, protects and uses information for the\nuniversity good.\n\uf0b7 Knowing what information the asset holds, and what information is transferred in or out\nof it and what systems it links to.\n\uf0b7 Know who has access and why, and ensure that their use is monitored.\n\uf0b7 Understanding and addressing risks to the asset, provide assurance to the SIRO and\nensure that any data loss incidents are reported and managed following BUL guidelines.\n\uf0b7 Ensuring compliance with BUL ISMS policies and all regulatory requirements as they\nrelate to the information assets.\n\uf0b7 The appropriate classification and protection of the information assets.\n\uf0b7 Ensuring all staff managing information assets are appropriately trained in managing,\nsecuring and accessing the assets.\n\uf0b7 Determining appropriate criteria for obtaining access to information assets3.\n\uf0b7 Authorising access to information assets in accordance with the classification and\nbusiness need.\n\uf0b7 Undertaking or commissioning information security risk assessments to ensure that the\ninformation security requirements are properly defined and documented.\n\uf0b7 Monitoring compliance with protection requirements affecting their assets.\n\uf0b7 Ensuring that contractual agreements exist for the transfer to, or processing by, any\nthird party.\nA number of senior staff will have de facto responsibility for the information assets under\ntheir control. For example, the HR Director will have responsibility for all the personnel\ninformation held within the organisation and will, in part, be responsible for determining\nhow it is used, accessed and stored.\n2 The named asset owners are aligned to the ISMS information asset registers that have been completed within\nBUL.\n3 An IAO is accountable for who has access to information assets both internally and externally.\nPROTECT Page 7 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 8 of 12\nAn IAO will be required to consider the following questions:\n\u2022 Do I understand what information assets I am responsible for (including personal and\nnon-personal data) and has that understanding been properly documented within\nthe Information Asset Register (IAR) and shared with the SIRO and others who need\nthat information?\n\u2022 Have I assessed and logged information risks to those assets?\n\u2022 Do I have a plan for managing risks, and validating that security controls are in place?\n\u2022 Do my team(s) and third parties understand their roles and responsibilities in\nmanaging those risks and controls?\nThe SIRO, CISO, Cyber & INFOSEC team and Data Protection Officer are all organisational\nleads able to provide guidance support and advice in the management of information\nassets.\n9. Risks to be Managed\nAn Information Asset Owner shall need to assure against:\n\u2022 Inappropriate access to, or disclosure of, protectively marked or sensitive personal\ndata by staff, contractors and outsiders, whether accidental or deliberate\n\u2022 Inappropriate data sharing \u2013 too much or irrelevant data is shared internally i.e. a full\nlist with all personal data is provided where only numbers of a specific category have\nbeen requested.\n\u2022 Internal threat \u2013 staff acting in error or deliberately, or external parties getting your\ninformation illegally and exposing it/acting maliciously to defraud.\n\u2022 Information loss \u2013 particularly during transfer or movement of information, or as a\nresult of business or regulatory change\n\u2022 Loss of ready access to information\n\u2022 Records management \u2013 that information assets are not retained for longer than\nrequired (either by law or for business need) as outlined in the corporate retention\nand disposal schedule.\n\u2022 Business continuity/disaster recovery \u2013 that the relevant personnel are aware of the\nagreed continuity and recovery for their services.\nPROTECT Page 8 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 9 of 12\n\u2022 Loss of digital continuity \u2013 i.e. losing the ability to use information in the way required\nwhen required. By use we mean being able to find, open, work with, understand and\ntrust your information. The lifecycle of a piece of information \u2013 and how long you need\nto use and keep it \u2013 is often different to the lifecycle of the IT system that we have to\naccess and use it\n\u2022 Poor quality of information and poor quality assurance, for example, of datasets\n\u2022 Poor change management \u2013 business needs change, systems change, your information\nrisk appetite may change, so you need to keep your policies and processes in step\naccordingly\n10. Information Leads\nAn Information Lead should understand the overall business goals of the organisation and\nthe importance of the information assets in supporting these goals. Information Leads\nshould understand the IAOs responsibilities and lead in ensuring the methods outlined in\nAnnex A are fully exploited to support delivery.\nInformation Leads will be expected to:\n\uf0b7 Review the IAR on a six monthly basis and ensure that the IAR is maintained and\nupdated when new assets are created.\n\uf0b7 Ensure that retention periods for information are documented in the retention\nschedule. Arrange for documented audits to ensure that information is deleted in\naccordance with retention periods.\n\uf0b7 Ensure that decisions are clearly recorded against any information that is retained\nover its agreed retention period.\n\uf0b7 Ensure that managers understand the importance of maintaining correct access\ncontrols of drives and systems.\n\uf0b7 Carry out regular audits of systems and drives to ensure correct access controls are\nmaintained.\n\uf0b7 Ensure that local information handling guidelines are in place and that these refer to\ncorporate guidance where appropriate.\n\uf0b7 Provide assurance to the IAO on a regular basis.\n\uf0b7 Attend training as required.\n11. Annual Reporting\nIAOs will be required to provide annual assurance on the following areas to the SIRO. This\nreport will be presented to Executive Board.\n\uf0b7 That local procedures governing the use of data are in place and updated when\nrequired.\nPROTECT Page 9 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 10 of 12\n\uf0b7 That access control measures are in place for systems, which includes how access is\ngranted and removed for users.\n\uf0b7 That updates on data flows (links to other systems) and reasons are provided.\n\uf0b7 That action following security incidents are monitored and updated.\n\uf0b7 That any records management responsibilities are captured (for example, the\nretention schedule is reviewed annually and that any system(s) used to store\ninformation have been reviewed to ensure retention is reflected.\n\uf0b7 Contracts with data processers have the agreed information security and GDPR\nclauses and compliance with these are monitored.\n\uf0b7 That appropriate Information Sharing Agreements are in place and reviewed where\nrequired.\n\uf0b7 That actions identified during audits are captured in the IAR where required.\n12. Guidance and Training\nAll IAO\u2019s and Information leads will receive the relevant baseline, and on the job training to\nbe able to undertake the roles and responsibilities. A specific IAO guidance shall be available\nto support the day to day management and security of the information assets under\nownership.\n13. Governance, Approval and Review\nThis policy and the university\u2019s commitment to a robust information assurance framework\nare subject to continuous, systematic review and improvement. This university-wide policy\noperates as part of the ISMS and shall be governed by the Information subcommittee.\n-End-\nPROTECT Page 10 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 11 of 12\nAnnex A\nIdentifying an IAO\nAn IAO must have the power to make decisions about how Information Assets are managed.\nTherefore this role must be a senior member of staff. These posts will typically be assigned\nto Directors or Heads of Department.\nThe post holder must have the skills, resources and authority to discharge the\nresponsibilities and take action on any deficiencies in the relevant processes.\nAll IAOs must attend IAO training provided by the university which will include onsite\nsessions in the initial creation phase, followed by specific cyber security and GDPR training\nsessions. IAOs must attend subsequent training where it is identified.\nIdentifying Information Assets\nAssessing every individual file, database entry or piece of information isn\u2019t realistic -\ntherefore the university and its departments needs to group information into manageable\nportions, and classify the data according to its value and sensitivity.\nTo assess whether something is an information asset, ask the following questions:\nValue: Does the information have a value to the organisation? How useful is it? Will it cost\nmoney to reacquire? Would there be legal, reputational or financial repercussions if you\ncouldn\u2019t produce it on request? Would it adversely impact operational efficiency if you\ncould not access it easily? Would there be consequences of not having it?\nRisk: Is there a risk associated with the information? Is there a risk of losing it? A risk that is\nnot accurate? A risk that someone may try to tamper with it? A risk arising from\ninappropriate disclosure?\nRetention: Does the group of information have a manageable lifecycle? Were all the\ncomponents created for a common purpose? Will they be disposed of in the same way and\naccording to the same rules?\nPROTECT Page 11 of 12\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 26/04/18\nPage: 12 of 12\nPROTECT Page 12 of 12"

Access to\nprivate keys must be restricted to identified individuals and stored on a\nnetwork share which only authorised staff, security and IS personnel can\naccess. The server must comply with the requirements for physical protection\nof assets;\n\uf0b7 Brunel University London shall use the United States National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) FIPS-140-2 compliant encryption\nalgorithms where appropriate;\n\uf0b7 The retention of keys associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures;\n2.2 Data encryption for secure network transit\n2.2.1 Provided no other restrictions apply, it is permitted for all University staff\nand students to use computer systems which would normally and by default use\nencryption, in order to secure data in transit on a communications network.\n2.2.2 Whenever possible and appropriate, encryption shall be used to support\nsecurity of remote access connections to the University's network and computing\nresources.\n2.3 Required use of encryption\n2.3.1 Loss, theft, or unauthorised disclosure of certain information could be\ndetrimental to the University, its staff or students. Such information includes that\ndefined as personal data by the Data Protection Act 2018. Where the University\nis handling digital personal data that cannot be sufficiently secured by physical\ncontrols, the data must be encrypted.\nData which must be handled securely, using encryption where pertinent,\nincludes:\n\uf0b7 Any personal data classed as \u201cspecial category\u201d by the Data Protection Act.\n1 Data protection Impact Assessment - is a procedure that describes a data processing and identifies its needs, its adequacy\nand its risks\nProtect Page 7 of 11\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-10.1.1\nIssue No: 6\nIssue Date: 07/08/2019\nPage: 8 of 11\n\uf0b7 Any data, that is not in the public domain, about a significant number of\nidentifiable individuals.\n\uf0b7 Personal data in any quantity where its protection is justified because of the\nnature of the individuals, source of the information, or extent of the information.\nData as described above must be encrypted:\n\uf0b7 Where it is stored on a computing device or any computer storage medium\nwhich may be exposed to a significant risk of being lost or stolen. (Computers\nused to access remotely stored data or to process locally stored data may create\ncache files. Depending on the technology in use persistent and unencrypted\ncache files may be created.) Any such device when outside a secure University\nlocation is considered to be at significant risk, including home computers.\n\uf0b7 Where it is to be transmitted via an external computer network using a\nmechanism that does not itself incorporate encryption. Depending on the specific\ntechnology being used this could refer to: sending data by email either within or\noutside the University, transferring files offsite, remotely accessing files or Web\npages. The risk is that unencrypted data in transit may be intercepted.\n\uf0b7 When the data is being sent using a postal service where the data media\ncould be lost, stolen or intercepted and read whilst in transit.\n2.3.2 Where data being handled by the University is subject to an agreement\nwith an external organisation specifying use of encryption, the agreed handling\nprocedures, encryption technologies and standards must be used.\n2.3.3 Where personal data is to be encrypted and no overriding requirements\n(from an external body) apply, the recommended minimum University encryption\nstandards (or better) must be applied. For further details refer below to the\n\u201cCryptography implementation\u201d section.\n2.3.4 Individuals must be authorised by the Head of Department before taking or\nsending University confidential information out of a secure University location.\nOptionally the Head of Department may elect to authorise specific individuals to\nroutinely undertake a particular activity involving a specific type of data. A\ndepartmental record of such authorisations is to be established and maintained\nrecording the following details:\n\uf0b7 The data name or description.\n\uf0b7 Who has been authorised to remove the data.\n\uf0b7 Purpose for which the data is being removed.\n\uf0b7 Date of data removal or an indication where removal is routine, e.g. \u201cduring\nexam marking\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Where the data is being taken or sent.\n\uf0b7 Any agreed external security requirements that apply to the data.\n\uf0b7 Confirmation that the data will be encrypted and handled securely.\n\uf0b7 Encryption technology used e.g. name of encryption hardware or software.\nIf the data being sent off campus is of a personal identifiable nature, the Data\nProtection Officer must be consulted prior to the release.\n2.3.5 University Web transactions that involve the transfer of personal, special\ncategory or University Confidential data or funds must use encryption, for\nProtect Page 8 of 11\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-10.1.1\nIssue No: 6\nIssue Date: 07/08/2019\nPage: 9 of 11\nexample, Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer or Transport\nSecurity Layer (HTTPS).\n2.4 Management of encryption keys\n2.4.1 Departmental procedures must be in place:\n\uf0b7 To manage encryption keys in a way that ensures encrypted stored data will\nneither become unrecoverable nor accessible by an unauthorised person.\n\uf0b7 To facilitate authorised officers of the University to obtain prompt access to\nthe encrypted information in the case of an emergency or investigation.\n\uf0b7 To ensure that encryption keys are stored and always communicated\nsecurely.\n\uf0b7 To record who holds encryption keys relating to important information.\n\uf0b7 To revoke encryption keys when key holders leave.\n2.4.2 Where University information received as email has been encrypted for\nsecure transit, and is information which may be needed again later, it should be\nsecurely stored in a form which does not rely on ongoing accessibility of the\nsenders public key.\n2.5 Required use of digital signatures\n2.5.1 Significant University business information being communicated\nelectronically should be authenticated by use of digital signatures; information\nreceived without a digital signature should not be relied upon. Staff involved\nmust assess the level of risk and decide whether to require use of digital\nsignatures or whether to use an alternative means to authenticate the\ncommunication.\n2.6 Unsupported use of encryption\n2.6.1 Staff and students should:\n\uf0b7 Not store encrypted data on University systems except where they are able to\njustify doing so for legitimate purposes.\n\uf0b7 Be aware that the University reserves the rights to request sight, at any time,\nof the unencrypted version of any data stored on its systems and the option to\nremove any data.\n2.7. Cryptography implementation\n2.7.1 All encryption products, standards and procedures used to protect\nUniversity Confidential data must be ones which have received substantial public\nreview and have been proven to work effectively. (see 3.0 algorithm\nrequirements)\n2.7.2 Where a department elects to undertake an activity that would incur a cost,\nin order to remain compliant with security policy, then that cost should normally\nbe found from the departmental budget. For example, where a research project\nrequires measures for secure data handling it is appropriate that costs for any\nnecessary additional security measures are factored into the tender.\nProtect Page 9 of 11\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-10.1.1\nIssue No: 6\nIssue Date: 07/08/2019\nPage: 10 of 11\n3.0 Algorithm Requirements\n3.1 Ciphers in use must meet or exceed the set defined as \"AES-compatible\" or\n\"partially AES-compatible\" according to the set defined for use in the United\nStates National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication FIPS\n140-2, or any superseding documents according to the date of implementation.\nThe use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is strongly recommended\nfor symmetric encryption.\n3.2 Algorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST\npublication FIPS 140-2 or any superseding document, according to date of\nimplementation.

Scope\nThe CIST shall utilise the risk management approaches stated within this handbook to identify\nvulnerabilities, threats and mitigating controls associated with University business processes,\npeople, technologies and services. This handbook and the supporting tools / resources can be\nadopted by any University department or college.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is the owner of this handbook and shall ensure\nthat it remains operationally fit for purpose and is appropriately communicated.\n4. Information Risk Assessments\n4.1 Types of risk assessments\nThe following risk management approaches will be capable of identifying the majority of\nknown information security vulnerabilities and threats that could impact the University.\nStandard Risk Used for generic asset based risk assessments,\nAssessment Risk mitigation based on industry good practice,\nCIA Approach e.g. ISO 27002\nThird Party Security Used to assess third parties who process\nUniversity information\nAssessment\nSupports procurement and legal due diligence\nCloud Security Used to identify risks posed by cloud service\nChecklist providers (CSP) \u2013 used in conjunction with TPSA\nData Protection Used to identify risks associated with processing\nImpact Assessment personal information - Can be applied to process,\ntechnologies or services\nBusiness Impact Used to identify recovery time / recovery point\nAssessment objectives -Can be applied to technologies,\nservices, personnel and associated processes\n4.2 Information Security Risk Register\nRisks identified from the varying risk management approaches shall be recorded in a\nsuitable information security risk register. The CIST shall maintain a central register on\nbehalf of the University, to support the uniform recording of risks and management\nreporting.\nPROTECT Page 5 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 6 of 15\nAs a minimum the following information shall be recorded for each risk:\n\u2022 Unique risk number or identifier\n\u2022 Date risk identified\n\u2022 Asset(s) at risk\n\u2022 Identified threat and vulnerability\n\u2022 Risk scenario treatment option\n\u2022 Risk owner or person accepting risk, e.g. Service Owner or Head of House/Department\n\u2022 Identified risk treatment plan (RTP) or controls identified to mitigate risk\n\u2022 Identified residual risk(s)\n\u2022 Date risk last reviewed\n\u2022 Risk closure date\n4.3 Standard risk assessment\n4.3.1 Risk scenario elements\nThe standard risk assessment utilises the formula built into the Verinice1 tool and is aligned\nto ISO 27001/27002 and 270005 which provides good practice methodology for information\nsecurity management, controls and risk analysis - based on the Confidentiality, Integrity and\nAvailability (CIA) of assets.\nThe definitions for CIA are:\n\u2022 Confidentiality - property that information is not made available or disclosed\nto unauthorised individuals, entities, or processes\n\u2022 Integrity - property of accuracy and\ncompleteness\nAsset\n\u2022 Availability - property of being accessible\nand usable upon demand by an\nauthorised entity\nThe standard risk assessment approach is risk scenario\nbased. Risk scenarios are built by considering three Threat Vulnerability\nelements:\n\u2022 Asset\n\u2022 Vulnerability (ease of exploitation)\n1 Verinice is a tool for managing information security and supports performing risk analysis based on ISO 27005;\nPROTECT Page 6 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 7 of 15\n\u2022 Threat (likelihood of threat occurrence)\nFor example: unauthorised access (threat) by a hacker on a web server (asset) that is not\nadequately patched (vulnerability). To support consistency of results and uniformity, the\nrisk scenario shall utilise a common set of vulnerabilities and threats adapted from ISO\n27005:2011 Information security risk management.\n4.3.2 Deriving the risk CIA score\nThe risk analysis within Verinice requires the following scoring:\n\u2022 Individual assets are scored for each CIA element, i.e. Low = 0, Medium = 1\nand High = 2.\n\u2022 Individual vulnerabilities are scored Very low = 0, Low = 1, Medium = 2 or\nHigh =3.\n\u2022 Individual threats are scored Rare = 0, Annual = 1, Monthly = 2 or Weekly =3.\nOnce a vulnerability and threat has been associated with an asset, a risk analysis can be run\nwithin Verinice to derive the risk score for an asset. Each asset will have a derived risk score\nfor CIA from adding the vulnerability and threat score to the original asset CIA score.\nFor example: Asset CIA is Low, High, Medium (0, 2, 1) and vulnerability is Medium (2) and\nthreat score is Weekly (3), then the derived risk CIA score for the asset is 5,7,6.\nWhen summed the derived risk score will provide a numerical score between 0 and 24. Risk\nacceptance criteria and associated risk decision options have been set for these scores.\nThese scores can then be aligned to the university risk management policy and scoring\nsystem for strategic risk reporting \u2013 and sitting behind these score are the CIST detailed\nscoring.\n4.3.3 Risk scenario treatment options\nThe next step is to cross reference the risk score against the risk score matrix to identify one\nof the following risk scenario treatment options:\n\u2022 Accept - a justifiable decision by the risk owner to accept and not implement\na risk treatment plan to mitigate the risk.\n\u2022 Avoid - typically involves either removing the asset, or changing or\nterminating the associated asset processes to avoid the risk.\n\u2022 Reduce - implementation of a risk treatment plan to lower the residual risk\nto an acceptable level.\nPROTECT Page 7 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 8 of 15\n\u2022 Transfer \u2013 the risk is shared with another party that can most effectively\nmanage the particular risk depending on risk evaluation.\nThe option to accept a risk shall be evaluated and periodically reviewed by the Cyber &\nInformation Security Team to ensure the original decision remains justifiable.\n4.3.4 Risk treatment plans and controls\nIf the risk scenario treatment option is to avoid, reduce or transfer, then a risk treatment\nplan (RTP) shall be documented and communicated to the appropriate risk owner for\napproval and, where applicable, implementation.\nThe mitigating controls identified within the RTP shall be based on controls stated in ISO\n27002 \u2013 Code of practice for information security, although where applicable, other security\ncontrols can be used.\n4.3.5 Risk owners\nFor each risk scenario a risk owner shall be identified and recorded in the information\nsecurity risk register. The risk owner shall be the person or entity with the accountability\nand authority to manage a risk. Risk owners are usually the asset or service owner, Heads of\nDepartment or Dean / Director. Additionally there may be more than one risk owner.\n4.3.6 Residual risks\nResidual risk is the risk that remains after the risk treatment. Where applicable, residual\nrisks shall be treated as a new risk scenario and be assessed accordingly.\n4.4 Third Party Security Assessment (TPSA)\nThe Third Party Security Assessment (TPSA) is used to assess the security controls of third\nparties who will be processing University information as part of a contractual service or\nformal agreement. The TPSA is aligned to the control areas within ISO 27002 \u2013 Code of\npractice for information security. The TPSA control areas map to the headings used in the\nSecurity Schedule Template. Where applicable the Security Schedule Template shall be\nnegotiated, agreed and included as an appendix within the overall contractual arrangement\nwith relevant third parties.\n4.5 Cloud Security Checklist\nThe Cloud Security Checklist is typically used to check whether a cloud service provider\u2019s\nPROTECT Page 8 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 9 of 15\nstandard terms and conditions or service level agreements contain adequate security\ncontrols to protect University information.\n4.6 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process which helps the University to\nidentify and reduce privacy risks that may exist within an information processing activity,\ne.g. business process, project, technology or service. A DPIA enables the University to\nsystematically analyse how a particular information processing activity will impact personal\ninformation and ensure that any processing is compliant with the General Data Protection\nRegulation. (GDPR).\nThe University\u2019s Governance, Information, and Legal Office provide services to enable\ncompliance with risks relating to the DPA, personal information and privacy.\n4.7 Business impact analysis (BIA)\nThe business impact analysis (BIA) is a process for assessing the impacts of disrupting\nactivities on University business processes, people, technologies and services. The BIA shall\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 identifying critical activities that support the day- to- day operations of the\nUniversity;\n\u2022 assessing the impacts over time of not performing these activities;\u037e\n\u2022 setting prioritised timeframes for resuming these activities at a specified\nminimum acceptable level, taking into consideration the time within which\nthe impacts of not resuming them would become unacceptable;\u037e and\n\u2022 identifying dependencies and supporting resources for these activities,\nincluding suppliers, outsource partners and other relevant interested parties.\nThe output from a BIA supports the development of business continuity plans.\nIndividual departments and colleges are responsible for the development and maintenance\nof fit for purpose business continuity plans.\n5.

Introduction\nThe Information Asset Owner (IAO) is a university mandated role, aligned to the Information\nSecurity Management System. Individuals are appointed as IAO and are responsible for\nensuring that information assets are handled and managed appropriately. This means making\nsure that information assets are properly protected and that their value to the organisation\nis fully exploited.\nAn Information Asset Owner reports to the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)1, who in\nturn reports to the Executive Board.\nThe role is a standard requirement of an ISO 27001 Information Security Management System\n(ISMS) and supports the provision of a common, consistent and unambiguous understanding\nof what information is held, how important it is, how sensitive it is, the risk to it, and who is\nresponsible for it.\n2. Purpose of the Handbook\nThis handbook sets out the university\u2019s approach to managing and securing its information\nand data assets. It explains the concept of an \u2018Information Asset\u2019 and defines the role of the\n\u2018Information Asset Owner\u2019 who is responsible for each Information Asset. This handbook also\nacts as a specific guide for the IAO and sets out the primary responsibilities of an IAO for the\nrisk and operational management of information assets including personal data and business\ncritical information held within a college or directorate.\nThe handbook also explains how IAOs will report on metrics to the SIRO throughout the\nreporting cycle.\nThe University\u2019s Information Security Policy states that:\n\u201cBrunel University London will maintain an Information Security Management\nSystem (ISMS) to preserve its competitive edge, educational excellence, cash-flow,\ndata protection, customer confidence and reputational image.\nBrunel University will ensure that the individuals, roles, bodies and governing\nframeworks are in place to maintain security ownership and responsibilities.\u201d\n1 Chief Information Officer\nPROTECT Page 5 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 6 of 24\nA guiding principle of our Strategy document is that \u2018All information and systems will have\nidentified owners.\u2019 This document formally establishes the roles and responsibilities for\nIAOs within the University Information Security Management System framework.\n3.

Background\nThe university holds a wealth of information. This information can be in different formats and\nheld in a variety of locations and systems. It is essential that the university understands the\ninformation it holds so that we can adequately manage and protect it.\nTo manage this information, the university needs to have Information Asset Registers (IAR)\nwhich are managed by Information Asset Owners. Information Asset Owners are senior\nmembers of staff who have been appointed to be responsible for one or more identified\ninformation asset(s). This person will be responsible for ensuring that the Information Asset\nis accurately stored and maintained on the Information Asset Register. The full university\nInformation Asset Register will be owned by the office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO).\nPerforming the role well brings significant benefits. It provides a common, consistent and\nunambiguous understanding of what information the university holds, how important it is,\nhow sensitive it is, how accurate it is, how reliant the university is on it, and who is responsible\nfor it.\nThe organisation of BUL Information Assurance is shown below:\nPROTECT Page 6 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 7 of 24\nV1.0\nUniversity Committees & Executive Board\nAsset\nOwners\nBusiness Units\nSIRO\nColleges Research Service GDPR\nDepts\nInformation Asset Owners Senio P r o In li f c o y r m & a C t o io m n p R li i a s n k c O e wner Data Protection\nOfficer\nInformation Asset Leads\nGeneral Data Protection\nRegulations\nRisk\nHead of Risk\nData Asset\nCustodians Cyber & Protection\nINFOSEC Strategic and\nIT Governance & operational risk\nCyber Security Technical Controls\nINFOSEC Risk Management, assurance, ISMS Framework & Head of Security &\nGovernance, Audits, Investigations, compliance Emergency Planning\nIT Teams Cyber and INFOSEC Team Information Exchange for Metrics\nPhysical Security,\nAudits, Investigations\nHead IT Infra & Ops Head Development\n& Apps CISO\nIT Governance, Policy & Cyber & INFOSEC Cyber & Reporting of Operational Risk\nSystems managements Controls INFOSEC\nManager\nBusiness Unit Heads of IT Cyber and Information Security Ops & Plans,\nProjects & Audits\nOrganisation of BUL\nCyber Security Cyber Security\nAuditor Officer Information\nInformation Asset Audits & Controls Advice\nSecurity Management System (ISMS)\n5. Principles\nThe IAO role is about managing information not systems.\nThe driver for establishing the role of the IAO within the ISMS is to ensure that information\nassets, whether personal data or business data, are identified and securely handled. This also\ninvolves making sure that they are used in the way that is required, for as long as required.\nThe IAO is responsible for ensuring that information is protected appropriately, and where\nthe information is shared, that proper confidentiality, integrity and availability safeguards\napply and are in place.\nThe IAO role is about providing information assurance and making sure that action is taken to\nsecure information assets, their movement and sharing is appropriately managed, and that\ncontracts are in place where they are shared with 3rd parties.\nPROTECT Page 7 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 8 of 24\nAn IAO can delegate responsibility to particular areas that can support the role but the IAO\nand SIRO retain the accountability for proper information management and handling.\n6. Asset Management\nAn information asset is a body of information, defined and managed as a single unit, so that\nit can be understood, shared, protected and exploited effectively. Information assets have\nrecognisable and manageable value, risk, content and lifecycles. They include physical and\ndigital assets and are recorded in an information asset register \u2013 held centrally within the\nISMS and locally within colleges and directorates.\nThe university SIRO will decide what information assets IAO\u2019s are responsible for. This could\ncover both sensitive personal data and non-personal information that is critical to business.\nIt could be held in paper as well as electronic formats.\nWhen an IAO is appointed, performance metrics will be discussed and agreed. Some of\nthese will be directly related to the need to demonstrate compliance with mandatory\nrequirements, but others may be specific to colleges or directorates.\n7. Information Asset Register\nAn Information Asset Register (IAR) is a mechanism for understanding and managing the\nuniversity\u2019s assets and the risks to them. The IAR should include links between the\ninformation assets, their business requirements or processes and any technical\ndependencies that there may be. An IAR is dynamic and should be consistently updated and\nimproved to ensure each business unit develops a \u2018mature\u2019 understanding of the\ninformation that it holds.\nThe Cyber & INFOSEC teams have developed a standardised asset register but general\ninformation on the types of assets and how to develop the registers can be seen at Annex A.\n\u2013End Part 1-\nPROTECT Page 8 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 9 of 24\nPART 2 \u2013 IAO HANDBOOK AND ROLES\n8. Roles and Responsibilities\nSenior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) Information Asset Owners (IAO)\nThe Senior Information Risk Owner is a Chief The SIRO is supported by the BUL IAOs. The\nOfficer with allocated lead responsibility for the role of IAO is to understand what information\norganisation\u2019s information risks and provides is held, what is added and what is removed,\nthe focus for management of information. The who has access and why in their own area. As a\nSIRO provides the Executive Board with result they are able to identify and address\nassurance that information risk is being risks to the information assets they \u2018own\u2019 and\nmanaged appropriately and effectively across to provide assurance to the SIRO on the\nthe organisation and for any services contracted security and use of the assets. The organisation\nby the organisation. has allocated this role to Directors and Senior\nDepartmental Heads and/or Managers for each\ncollege, institute or directorate.\nThe CIO undertakes the role of Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) for BUL. The SIRO\u2019s\nresponsibilities can be summarised as:\n\u2022 Leading and fostering a culture that values, protects and uses information for the\nsuccess of the organisation and benefit of its clients and stakeholders.\n\u2022 Owning the organisation\u2019s overall information risk policy and risk assessment processes\nand ensuring they are implemented consistently.\n\u2022 Advising the VC & COO or relevant accounting officer on the information risk aspects of\ninternal controls.\nInformation Asset Owners\nInformation Asset Owners (IAOs) are Directors and Heads of Departments responsible for\nthe protection of particular Information Assets2. IAOs may delegate information security\ntasks to managers or other individuals but remain accountable for the proper\nimplementation of the tasks.\n2 The named asset owners are aligned to the ISMS information asset registers that have been completed within\nBUL.\nPROTECT Page 9 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 10 of 24\nThe IAO is expected to understand the overall business goals of the university and how the\ninformation assets they own contribute to and affect these goals. The IAO should nominate\nat least one Information Lead to support the IAO on a day-to-date basis.\nIAOs are responsible for:\n\u2022 Leading and fostering a culture that values, protects and uses information for the good\nof the university.\n\u2022 Knowing what information the asset holds, and what information is transferred in or out\nof it and what systems it links to.\n\u2022 Knowing who has access and why, and ensuring that their use is monitored.\n\u2022 Understanding and addressing risks to the asset, providing assurance to the SIRO and\nensuring that any data loss incidents are reported and managed following BUL\nguidelines.\n\u2022 Ensuring compliance with BUL ISMS policies and all regulatory requirements as they\nrelate to the information assets.\n\u2022 The appropriate classification and protection of the information assets.\n\u2022 Ensuring all staff managing information assets are appropriately trained in managing,\nsecuring and accessing the assets.\n\u2022 Determining appropriate criteria for obtaining access to information assets3.\n\u2022 Authorising access to information assets in accordance with the classification and\nbusiness need.\n\u2022 Undertaking or commissioning information security risk assessments to ensure that the\ninformation security requirements are properly defined and documented.\n\u2022 Monitoring compliance with protection requirements affecting their assets.\n\u2022 Ensuring that contractual agreements exist for the transfer to, or processing by, any\nthird party.\nA number of senior staff will have de facto responsibility for the information assets under\ntheir control. For example, the HR Director will have responsibility for all the personnel\ninformation held within the organisation and will, in part, be responsible for determining\nhow it is used, accessed and stored.\nAn IAO will be required to consider the following questions:\n\u2022 Do I understand what information assets I am responsible for (including personal and\nnon-personal data) and has that understanding been properly documented within\nthe Information Asset Register (IAR) and shared with the SIRO and others who need\nthat information?\n\u2022 Have I assessed and logged information risks to those assets?\n\u2022 Do I have a plan for managing risks, and validating that security controls are in place?\n3 An IAO is accountable for who has access to information assets both internally and externally.\nPROTECT Page 10 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 11 of 24\n\u2022 Do my team(s) and third parties understand their roles and responsibilities in\nmanaging those risks and controls?\nThe SIRO, CISO, Cyber & INFOSEC team and Data Protection Officer are all organisational\nleads able to provide guidance support and advice in the management of information\nassets.\n9. Risks to be Managed\nAn Information Asset Owner shall need to assure against:\n\u2022 Inappropriate access to, or disclosure of, protectively marked or sensitive personal\ndata by staff, contractors and outsiders, whether accidental or deliberate\n\u2022 Inappropriate data sharing where too much or irrelevant data is shared internally, i.e.\na full list with all personal data is provided where only numbers of a specific category\nhave been requested.\n\u2022 Information loss, particularly during transfer or movement of information, or as a\nresult of business or regulatory change\n\u2022 Loss of ready access to information\n\u2022 Records management \u2013 that information assets are not retained for longer than\nrequired (either by law or for business need) as outlined in the corporate retention\nand disposal schedule.\n\u2022 Business continuity/disaster recovery \u2013 that the relevant personnel are aware of the\nagreed continuity and recovery for their services.\n\u2022 Loss of digital continuity \u2013 i.e. losing the ability to use information in the way required\nwhen required. By use we mean being able to find, open, work with, understand and\ntrust your information. The lifecycle of a piece of information \u2013 and how long you need\nto use and keep it \u2013 is often different to the lifecycle of the IT system that we have to\naccess and use it\n10. Information Asset Administrators (IAA)\nAn Information asset administrator (IAA) should understand the overall business goals of\nthe organisation and the importance of the information assets in supporting these goals.\nInformation asset administrators should understand the IAOs responsibilities and lead in\nensuring the methods outlined in Annex A are fully exploited to support delivery.\nPROTECT Page 11 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 12 of 24\nIAA\u2019s will be expected to:\n\u2022 Review the IAR on a six-monthly basis and ensure that the IAR is maintained and\nupdated when new assets are created.\n\u2022 Ensure that retention periods for information are documented in the retention\nschedule. Arrange for documented audits to ensure that information is deleted in\naccordance with retention periods.\n\u2022 Ensure that decisions are clearly recorded against any information that is retained\nlonger than its agreed retention period.\n\u2022 Ensure that managers understand the importance of maintaining correct access\ncontrols of drives and systems.\n\u2022 Carry out regular audits of systems and drives to ensure correct access controls are\nmaintained.\n\u2022 Ensure that local information handling guidelines are in place where required and\nthat these refer to corporate guidance where appropriate.\n\u2022 Provide assurance to the IAO on a regular basis.\n\u2022 Attend training as required.\n-End Part 2-\nPROTECT Page 12 of 24\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 13 of 24\nPART 3 \u2013 REPORTING TO SIRO\n11. Annual Reporting\nIAOs will be required to provide bi-annual assurance on the following areas to the SIRO.\nThis report will be presented to Executive Board and can be seen at Annex B. It will\ninclude reporting that:\n\u2022 Local procedures governing the use of data are in place and updated when required.\n\u2022 Access control measures are in place for systems, which includes how access is\ngranted and removed for users.\n\u2022 Updates on data flows (links to other systems) and reasons are provided.\n\u2022 Action following security incidents are monitored and updated.\n\u2022 Any records management responsibilities are captured (for example, the retention\nschedule is reviewed annually and that any system(s) used to store information have\nbeen reviewed to ensure retention is reflected.)\n\u2022 Contracts with data processers have the agreed information security and GDPR\nclauses and compliance with these are monitored. 4\n\u2022 Appropriate Information Sharing Agreements are in place and reviewed where\nrequired.\n\u2022 Actions identified during audits are captured in the IAR where required.\n12.

How useful is it? Will it cost money to\nreacquire? Would there be legal, reputational or financial repercussions if you couldn\u2019t produce it on\nrequest? Would it adversely impact operational efficiency if you could not access it easily? Would there\nbe consequences of not having it?\nRisk: Is there a risk associated with the information? Is there a risk of losing it? A risk that it is not\naccurate? A risk that someone may try to tamper with it? A risk arising from inappropriate disclosure?\nRetention: Does the group of information have a manageable lifecycle? Were all the components created\nfor a common purpose? Will they be disposed of in the same way and according to the same rules?\nPROTECT\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-6.1.2.1\nIssue No: 0.2 PROTECT\nIssue Date: 18/02/19\nPage: 24 of 24\nPROTECT"

Efficient management of such\nassets is also necessary in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations such as the Data\nProtection Act, and to ensure efficient handling of Freedom of Information requests.\nDifferent types of information require different security measures and hence proper classification\nof information assets is vital to ensuring effective information security and management. This\nInformation Classification Policy is intended to help staff and students to determine what\ninformation can be disclosed to external parties, as well as the relative sensitivity of information\nthat should not be disclosed outside of the University without proper authorisation.\nThis policy, along with the BUL-PROC-8.02 Information Classification guidelines, assists all\nmembers of the University to ensure that correct classification and handling methods are applied\nduring their day-to-day activities and information is managed accordingly.\n\u2022 University information assets should be made available to all those who have a legitimate\nneed to access them;\n\u2022 The integrity of information must be maintained; information must be accurate, complete,\ntimely and consistent with other related information and events.\nPlease refer to BUL-GLOS-000 - SyOPs for the glossary of terms, acronyms and their definitions\nfor the suite of BUL ISMS documentations.\n1.2 Responsibilities\nTable 1 \u2013 responsibilities\nTitle / Role Description\nAsset Owners \u2022 Are responsible for determining the classification of\n(as identified by the their assets\nUniversity) \u2022 To ensure assets are correctly labelled and for any\nsteps necessary to ensure their correct handling in\nline with their classification.\n\u2022 Are responsible for appropriate delegation to\ncustodians\nCyber & Information \u2022 Is responsible for maintaining the inventory of assets\nSecurity Manager and services together with their classification levels\nSystems Manager \u2022 Is responsible for technical labelling mechanisms\nProtect Page 3 of 6\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.2\nIssue No: 4\nIssue Date: 01/09/2020\nPage: 4 of 6\nAll Managers \u2022 Are responsible for providing direction, as\nappropriate, on mail/postal services, voice mail and\nvoice communication, fax machines, photocopiers,\ncouriers, and sensitive documents for ensuring that\nthese media or information types are handled in line\nwith these requirements\nAll employees \u2022 Any user of University information assets (including\nmobile phones, laptops and/or other peripherals)\nmay have specific custodianship responsibilities\nidentified in their user agreements and have a\nresponsibility to adhere to this policy\nISO 27001 - Conformance\nThis section indicates the University Conformance to ISO27001:2013.\nUniversity ISMS Control Number SOA \u2013 Number A8 \u2013 Asset management\nISO 27001:2013 Conformance Control Information Classification Objective\nA.8.2 - Information Classification\n1.3 Scope\nThis policy applies to:\n\u2022 All University data held on any medium, including all forms of hard copy and electronic\ndata.\n\u2022 All University Colleges, Research Institutes, Administrative and Service Departments.\n\u2022 All contractors, third party suppliers and external stakeholders.\nProtect Page 4 of 6\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.2\nIssue No: 4\nIssue Date: 01/09/2020\nPage: 5 of 6\n2.0 Classification Policy\n2.1\nThe University classifies information into three levels (University Confidential,\nProtect and Unclassified):\n\u2022 University Confidential must identify the individuals, roles, departments or\ncolleges to whom the information is restricted and is available only to those\nspecified and relevant members with authorisation (see BUL-POL-6.1.1 -\nInfoSec Roles);\nA breach of confidentiality could result in unacceptable damage with very\nserious and lasting consequences threatening the University or one of its\nactivities.\n\u2022 Protect is available to any authenticated member of the University. Typically,\nif this level of information was leaked outside of the University, it could be\ninappropriate or ill-timed.\n\u2022 Unclassified: available to any member of the public without restriction. This\ninformation, however, should not be placed into the public domain without\nreason, such as a request or promotional material.\n2.2\nIt is possible that we could receive information that is classified by Government or\nother institutions as Secret (HMG Information Security Classification April 2014).\nWe do not expect to classify any information generated at the University as secret.\nIt is reserved for information that could impact on National Security, potentially\ndestabilizing the UK or its allies, including information which is subject to the\nOfficial Secrets Act 1989. The information handling requirements associated with\nthis level will be dictated by the information owner on each occasion.\n2.3\nAll information held by or on behalf of the University will be categorised according\nto the Information Classification level (above).\n2.4\nThe information owner will assess the value, sensitivity and the risk of\nconfidentiality breach to their data set. Once the classification has been\nestablished any documents containing this information must be systematically\nmarked as such. It is recommended that each department or research group\nexplicitly identifies information owners. This however differs if you are including\nany Special Category Personal Data. Please refer to the Information Classification\nProcedure Paragraph 4.2 for further details.\n2.5\nAny information which is not explicitly marked will be classified as University\nConfidential, pending classification, by default to avoid data leakage. In the case\nof disagreement over the classification level to be used, the more secure level\nshould be adopted. Questions about the proper classification of a specific piece of\ninformation or a dataset should be addressed to your manager. Where there is a\nmix of information from different classification levels, the more secure level should\nbe adopted. Information that is sent externally must be marked with its\nclassification level unless already identified and marked as unclassified\nwhereupon no marking is required on the information distributed. All staff have a\nProtect Page 5 of 6\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-8.2\nIssue No: 4\nIssue Date: 01/09/2020\nPage: 6 of 6\nresponsibility for ensuring that any information sent externally, in any format or\nmedia, is correctly classified\n2.6\nAll information must be secured to meet the requirements of their respective\nclassification levels (as above). Guidance on the type of security controls that\nshould be implemented is available in the BUL-PROC-08.02 Information\nClassification.\n2.7\nThe classification must be included in the document footer, which must be\nmanually set to appear on all pages of the document, or on the media on which it\nis recorded.\n2.8\nInformation received from outside the University that is used within the ISMS scope\nmust be re-classified by its recipient so that, within the University, it complies with\nthis policy.\n2.9\nThe classification of information assets must be reviewed at least once a year by\nthe Asset Owners, and if the classification level can be reduced, it will be. The\nAsset Owner is responsible for de-classifying information.\n2.10\nAsset Owners may delegate ownership responsibility to specific individuals, and\nthis delegated responsibility is known as \u2018custodianship\u2019 (and the individuals\nconcerned are known as \u2018custodians\u2019).\n2.11\nWhere a third party will be responsible for handling the information on behalf of the\nUniversity, the third party shall be required by contract to adhere to this policy prior\nto the sharing of information.\nProtect Page 6 of 6"

Scope\nThe CIST shall utilise the risk management approaches stated within this handbook to identify\nvulnerabilities, threats and mitigating controls associated with University business processes,\npeople, technologies and services. This handbook and the supporting tools / resources can be\nadopted by any University department or college.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is the owner of this handbook and shall ensure\nthat it remains operationally fit for purpose and is appropriately communicated.\n4. Information Risk Assessments\n4.1 Types of risk assessments\nThe following risk management approaches will be capable of identifying the majority of\nknown information security vulnerabilities and threats that could impact the University.\nStandard Risk Used for generic asset based risk assessments,\nAssessment Risk mitigation based on industry good practice,\nCIA Approach e.g. ISO 27002\nThird Party Security Used to assess third parties who process\nUniversity information\nAssessment\nSupports procurement and legal due diligence\nCloud Security Used to identify risks posed by cloud service\nChecklist providers (CSP) \u2013 used in conjunction with TPSA\nData Protection Used to identify risks associated with processing\nImpact Assessment personal information - Can be applied to process,\ntechnologies or services\nBusiness Impact Used to identify recovery time / recovery point\nAssessment objectives -Can be applied to technologies,\nservices, personnel and associated processes\n4.2 Information Security Risk Register\nRisks identified from the varying risk management approaches shall be recorded in a\nsuitable information security risk register. The CIST shall maintain a central register on\nbehalf of the University, to support the uniform recording of risks and management\nreporting.\nPROTECT Page 5 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 6 of 15\nAs a minimum the following information shall be recorded for each risk:\n\u2022 Unique risk number or identifier\n\u2022 Date risk identified\n\u2022 Asset(s) at risk\n\u2022 Identified threat and vulnerability\n\u2022 Risk scenario treatment option\n\u2022 Risk owner or person accepting risk, e.g. Service Owner or Head of House/Department\n\u2022 Identified risk treatment plan (RTP) or controls identified to mitigate risk\n\u2022 Identified residual risk(s)\n\u2022 Date risk last reviewed\n\u2022 Risk closure date\n4.3 Standard risk assessment\n4.3.1 Risk scenario elements\nThe standard risk assessment utilises the formula built into the Verinice1 tool and is aligned\nto ISO 27001/27002 and 270005 which provides good practice methodology for information\nsecurity management, controls and risk analysis - based on the Confidentiality, Integrity and\nAvailability (CIA) of assets.\nThe definitions for CIA are:\n\u2022 Confidentiality - property that information is not made available or disclosed\nto unauthorised individuals, entities, or processes\n\u2022 Integrity - property of accuracy and\ncompleteness\nAsset\n\u2022 Availability - property of being accessible\nand usable upon demand by an\nauthorised entity\nThe standard risk assessment approach is risk scenario\nbased. Risk scenarios are built by considering three Threat Vulnerability\nelements:\n\u2022 Asset\n\u2022 Vulnerability (ease of exploitation)\n1 Verinice is a tool for managing information security and supports performing risk analysis based on ISO 27005;\nPROTECT Page 6 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 7 of 15\n\u2022 Threat (likelihood of threat occurrence)\nFor example: unauthorised access (threat) by a hacker on a web server (asset) that is not\nadequately patched (vulnerability). To support consistency of results and uniformity, the\nrisk scenario shall utilise a common set of vulnerabilities and threats adapted from ISO\n27005:2011 Information security risk management.\n4.3.2 Deriving the risk CIA score\nThe risk analysis within Verinice requires the following scoring:\n\u2022 Individual assets are scored for each CIA element, i.e. Low = 0, Medium = 1\nand High = 2.\n\u2022 Individual vulnerabilities are scored Very low = 0, Low = 1, Medium = 2 or\nHigh =3.\n\u2022 Individual threats are scored Rare = 0, Annual = 1, Monthly = 2 or Weekly =3.\nOnce a vulnerability and threat has been associated with an asset, a risk analysis can be run\nwithin Verinice to derive the risk score for an asset. Each asset will have a derived risk score\nfor CIA from adding the vulnerability and threat score to the original asset CIA score.\nFor example: Asset CIA is Low, High, Medium (0, 2, 1) and vulnerability is Medium (2) and\nthreat score is Weekly (3), then the derived risk CIA score for the asset is 5,7,6.\nWhen summed the derived risk score will provide a numerical score between 0 and 24. Risk\nacceptance criteria and associated risk decision options have been set for these scores.\nThese scores can then be aligned to the university risk management policy and scoring\nsystem for strategic risk reporting \u2013 and sitting behind these score are the CIST detailed\nscoring.\n4.3.3 Risk scenario treatment options\nThe next step is to cross reference the risk score against the risk score matrix to identify one\nof the following risk scenario treatment options:\n\u2022 Accept - a justifiable decision by the risk owner to accept and not implement\na risk treatment plan to mitigate the risk.\n\u2022 Avoid - typically involves either removing the asset, or changing or\nterminating the associated asset processes to avoid the risk.\n\u2022 Reduce - implementation of a risk treatment plan to lower the residual risk\nto an acceptable level.\nPROTECT Page 7 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 8 of 15\n\u2022 Transfer \u2013 the risk is shared with another party that can most effectively\nmanage the particular risk depending on risk evaluation.\nThe option to accept a risk shall be evaluated and periodically reviewed by the Cyber &\nInformation Security Team to ensure the original decision remains justifiable.\n4.3.4 Risk treatment plans and controls\nIf the risk scenario treatment option is to avoid, reduce or transfer, then a risk treatment\nplan (RTP) shall be documented and communicated to the appropriate risk owner for\napproval and, where applicable, implementation.\nThe mitigating controls identified within the RTP shall be based on controls stated in ISO\n27002 \u2013 Code of practice for information security, although where applicable, other security\ncontrols can be used.\n4.3.5 Risk owners\nFor each risk scenario a risk owner shall be identified and recorded in the information\nsecurity risk register. The risk owner shall be the person or entity with the accountability\nand authority to manage a risk. Risk owners are usually the asset or service owner, Heads of\nDepartment or Dean / Director. Additionally there may be more than one risk owner.\n4.3.6 Residual risks\nResidual risk is the risk that remains after the risk treatment. Where applicable, residual\nrisks shall be treated as a new risk scenario and be assessed accordingly.\n4.4 Third Party Security Assessment (TPSA)\nThe Third Party Security Assessment (TPSA) is used to assess the security controls of third\nparties who will be processing University information as part of a contractual service or\nformal agreement. The TPSA is aligned to the control areas within ISO 27002 \u2013 Code of\npractice for information security. The TPSA control areas map to the headings used in the\nSecurity Schedule Template. Where applicable the Security Schedule Template shall be\nnegotiated, agreed and included as an appendix within the overall contractual arrangement\nwith relevant third parties.\n4.5 Cloud Security Checklist\nThe Cloud Security Checklist is typically used to check whether a cloud service provider\u2019s\nPROTECT Page 8 of 15\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-4.1\nIssue No: 2\nIssue Date: 09/12/17\nPage: 9 of 15\nstandard terms and conditions or service level agreements contain adequate security\ncontrols to protect University information.\n4.6 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process which helps the University to\nidentify and reduce privacy risks that may exist within an information processing activity,\ne.g. business process, project, technology or service. A DPIA enables the University to\nsystematically analyse how a particular information processing activity will impact personal\ninformation and ensure that any processing is compliant with the General Data Protection\nRegulation. (GDPR).\nThe University\u2019s Governance, Information, and Legal Office provide services to enable\ncompliance with risks relating to the DPA, personal information and privacy.\n4.7 Business impact analysis (BIA)\nThe business impact analysis (BIA) is a process for assessing the impacts of disrupting\nactivities on University business processes, people, technologies and services. The BIA shall\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 identifying critical activities that support the day- to- day operations of the\nUniversity;\n\u2022 assessing the impacts over time of not performing these activities;\u037e\n\u2022 setting prioritised timeframes for resuming these activities at a specified\nminimum acceptable level, taking into consideration the time within which\nthe impacts of not resuming them would become unacceptable;\u037e and\n\u2022 identifying dependencies and supporting resources for these activities,\nincluding suppliers, outsource partners and other relevant interested parties.\nThe output from a BIA supports the development of business continuity plans.\nIndividual departments and colleges are responsible for the development and maintenance\nof fit for purpose business continuity plans.\n5.

Information security risk management\nprovides this level of risk analysis to apply sensible and proportionate protection by applying the\ncorrect level of resource and safeguards \u2013 thus reducing risks to information to a level that is\nacceptable to the organisation and provides information assurance to the Executive Board.\nThe successful implementation of an information risk management framework across Brunel\nuniversity London (BUL) is essential to ensure that information, in whatever format, is provided the\ncorrect level of protection commensurate with its sensitivity and criticality to BUL business and\noperations.\nISO 27001 - Conformance\nThis section indicates the University Conformance to ISO27001:2013.\nUniversity ISMS Control Number Clause 4 \u2013 Context of the Organisation - Risk\nAssessment and Management\nISO 27001:2013 Conformance Control Information Classification Objective\nA.4.1 - Understanding the organisation and its context\nA.4.2 \u2013 Understanding the needs and expectations of\ninterested parties\nA.4.3 \u2013 Determining the scope of the Information\nSecurity Management System\n1.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this Information Security Risk Management Policy is to provide assurance to the\nExecutive Board that risks to information assets managed by, or on behalf of BUL, are being\nmanaged effectively and consistently across the organisation.\n1.2 Policy scope\nThis policy applies to anyone who has access to BUL Information Systems whether they are\nemployed or under a term of contact, including third parties. In effect, this policy applies to anyone\nworking within BUL regardless of location. It also extends to University information held by third\nparties and partners.\nThis policy encompasses the people, processes and technology that process, transmit, or store BUL\ninformation, both physical and electronic.\n1.3 University Risk Management Framework\nPage 4 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-IRM01\nIssue No: 4\nThe University has a comprehensive risk management framework that describes the University\u2019s\nIssue Date: 26/01/2018\napproach to risk management based on our collective experiences of managing risks and set against\nPage: 5 of 9\ngood practice drawn from the Office of Government Commerce\u2019s (OGC) \u2018Management of Risk:\nGuidance for Practitioners\u2019, and BS ISO 31000 \u201cRisk management - Principles and guidelines\u201d\nstandard.\nThe risk management framework comprises the Risk Management Policy and Risk Management\nProcedure, supported by the Risk Management Guidelines.\nThis Information Risk Management Policy is supplemental to the existing University Risk\nManagement Framework policy and procedures, predicated on the requirement to operate a risk\nmanagement system and methodology, specific to information security, and operating within the\nuniversity Information Security Management System (ISMS).\nInformation security risk management has a number of differing industry wide models, specifically\ndesigned for the nuances of information security risk scoring and assessments. BUL will adopt the\ngood practice methodologies of ISO 27005 \u2013 Information Security Risk Management \u2013 The precise\nmethodology and scoring in set out in an accompanying BUL policy document \u2013 BUL IRM02 Risk\nManagement Methodology.\nPage 5 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-IRM01\nIssue No: 4\n2 Information Risk Management Policy\nIssue Date: 26/01/2018\nPage: 6 of 9\n2.1 Information Security Risk Management.\nThe BUL cyber & INFOSEC team will apply an intelligence led, risk managed approach to\norganisational information security controls developed in alignment with the university risk\nappetite for securing information assets.\nThe risk management model that will be applied is based upon ISO 270051, aligned to ISO\n27001 and 27002, and operates with other good practice drawn from COBIT2 and UCISA3.\nProcesses shall be implemented so that information risks are appropriately assessed,\nresponded to, accepted, monitored and communicated to the Executive Board.\n2.2 Information Security Risk Analysis\nA documented risk analysis process is used as the basis for the identification, definition and\nprioritisation of risks. The risk analysis process shall include the following:\n\uf0b7 Identification and prioritisation of the threats to Information assets.\n\uf0b7 Identification and prioritisation of the vulnerabilities of Information assets.\n\uf0b7 Identification of a threat that may exploit a vulnerability documented as a cyber\nvulnerability assessment (CVA).\n\uf0b7 Qualitative identification of the impact to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\nInformation Resources if a threat exploits a specific vulnerability.\n\uf0b7 Identification and definition of measures and/or controls used to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of Information assets\nThe risk analysis process is documented through a cyber & information risk register, informed\nby:\n\uf0b7 Cyber vulnerability assessments (CVA).\n\uf0b7 Security Assessment Reports (SAR) \u2013 An annual ISMS assessment.\n\uf0b7 Penetration testing results.\n\uf0b7 Threat assessments.\n\uf0b7 Threat trends.\n\uf0b7 Intelligence reports.\nPage 6 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-IRM01\nIssue No: 4\nIssue Date: 26/01/2018\nPage: 7 of 9\nA strategic risk register is provided to executive board that provides an overall summary of\nstrategic risk, derived from the operation risk register and CVA\u2019s. These are regularly updated\nwhen environmental, operational or technical changes arise that impact the confidentiality,\nintegrity or availability of Information assets such as incidents, lessons identified, and\ntechnical changes, or new threats.\n2.3 Information Risk Assessment\nA systematic and structured information risk assessment methodology has been established\nso that the BUL can appropriately assess and respond to risks to its information assets. This\nmethodology is shown in the accompanying paper \u2018Information Security Risk Management\nMethodology\u2019 BUL-POL-IRM02.\n2.4 Threat and vulnerability\nInformation assets shall be evaluated for threats and vulnerabilities on a regular basis or when\na significant change or incident occurs. Threat and vulnerability shall be actively monitored\nvia threat and intelligence reports received by the cyber & INFOSEC team from a variety of\nsources.\n2.5 Control Evaluation\nInformation security controls and countermeasures, which have been implemented in\nresponse to risks, shall be evaluated regularly for effectiveness and suitability. Controls will be\nemplaced via the risk management principles of intelligence led, risk based, with controls\naligned to the ISMS statement of applicability (SoA).\n2.6 Information Asset Responsibilities\nAll information assets shall be recorded and Information Asset Owners identified in\naccordance with the defined principles of the ISMS and \u2018Role and Responsibilities\u2019 Policy\nPaper. Information asset owners are responsible for the classification and risk management\nof the assets.\n3 Asset Risk Management\nThe asset risk management process determines the specific threats and risks which affect the\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of all university information assets.\n3.1 Information Asset Identification and Profiling\n1 Information Security Risk Management\n2 Control Objectives for Information and Technology\n3 Universities and Colleges Information Systems Association\nPage 7 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-IRM01\nIssue No: 4\nAn information asset is essentially a distinct set of information which has some value to the\nIssue Date: 26/01/2018\norganisation.\nPage: 8 of 9\nWhen evaluating risk against an information asset, BUL information asset owners shall assess\nand document the assets to cover its profile entirety including:\n\uf0b7 Exactly what the asset is\n\uf0b7 Its requirements for confidentiality, integrity and availability\n\uf0b7 The lifecycle of the asset\n\uf0b7 The business processes which affect it\n\uf0b7 The value of the asset to the organisation\n\uf0b7 The expected value of the asset to an attacker\n\uf0b7 Its classification (see Information Security Classification Policy)\n\uf0b7 its expected lifespan.\n4 Risk Treatment\nRisk is treated by applying controls that modify the risk in such a way that it meets the specified\nRisk Acceptance Criteria. This is achieved through controls which either:\n\uf0b7 Reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring by attempting to prevent the occurrence of\nthe event, or detect it in sufficient time for the organisation to deal with it or\n\uf0b7 Reduce the severity of the risk by reacting to the consequence.\nThrough the use of controls it is planned that the likelihood or impact of the event can either be\neliminated or reduced greatly. The control may be performed by this organisation or another\nexternal organisation.\n4.1 Determination of Risk Treatment\nBUL shall adopt an information risk treatment methodology that provides an auditable trail of\ndecision making regarding each assessed risk. Aligned to the university risk treatment policy,\ninformation security risk treatment will be documented as one of four option in the risk\nregister:\n\uf0b7 Avoidance \u2013 ceasing the activity due to it being unacceptable risk\n\uf0b7 Reduction \u2013 placement of controls and contingency plans\n\uf0b7 Transfer \u2013 where applicable to third parties or using insurance\n\uf0b7 Tolerate \u2013 accepting the risk within risk appetite parameters\nCyber & Information security risk decision making shall be undertaken via the relevant\ncommittees assigned to review and monitor risk, with the Senior Information Risk Owner\n(SIRO) providing oversight to executive board.\nWhere reduction measures are emplaced, each risk event is analysed and documented to\ndetermine:\n\uf0b7 Controls which are required to prevent the event\nPage 8 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED\nDocument Control\nReference: BUL-POL-IRM01\nIssue No: 4\n\uf0b7 Controls which are required to detect the event\nIssue Date: 26/01/2018\n\uf0b7 Controls which are required to react to the associated consequences of the event\nPage: 9 of 9\n4.2 Monitoring and Reviewing Risks\nAll risks cyber & information security risks will be monitored and reviewed in accordance with\nthe arrangements specified in the University Risk Management Procedure. As a minimum,\noperational and strategic cyber & INFOSEC risks will be reviewed every six months.\nInformation Asset Owners, shall review the relevant risks to their own assets, on a 6 monthly\nbasis and provide reports and assessments to the SIRO, or asa required.\n4.3 Comparison with Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2013\nIn order to ensure that necessary controls have not been omitted from the Risk Treatment\nPlan they are compared with the controls in the statement of applicability (SoA) for ISO\n27001:2013 standard. Each control within the standard is considered and the following\ndetermined:\n\uf0b7 Is it applicable to the university SoA.\n\uf0b7 If it is a variant of an SoA control, or deemed as not being applicable, the reason for this\nshall be recorded.\n\uf0b7 What is the implementation status (Implemented; In Progress or Not Started)\n\uf0b7 If as a result of this process an SoA control is determined to be applicable, but isn\u2019t\nalready covered - the Risk Treatment Plan is revised to include it.\n4.4 Risk owner approval\nThe Information Security team shall engage and support the asset and risk owners to review\nrisk assessments and risk treatment plans. The risk owners ultimately approve the risk\ntreatment plans.\n-End-\nPage 9 of 9\nUNCLASSIFIED"
