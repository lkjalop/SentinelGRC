### ‚ùå **Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **Report Quality** - Current outputs are 11 pages, not 30-50 page professional reports
2. **Real Intelligence** - Models are simulated, not trained on actual compliance data
3. **Evidence Extraction** - Surface-level analysis, not detailed control mapping
4. **Threat Modeling** - No real purple team guidance or actionable insights
5. **Human Integration** - No clear handoff points for expert validation
6. **Specialized Models** - Need 8 framework-specific trained models
