## FOR YOUR VANTA INTERVIEW:

### Opening Line:
"I spent the weekend building what Vanta could become - the world's first threat-intelligence compliance platform with 800+ auditor questions, CVE mappings, and AI governance."

### Value Statement:
"I don't just understand compliance - I revolutionized it by connecting every control to real threats, quantifying business impact, and creating cross-framework optimization that saves ¬£200K annually."

### Differentiator:
"While others talk about features, I built them. Including ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI governance that was published in December 2023 - making this literally cutting-edge."

### Close:
"The question isn't whether I'm qualified for Vanta. The question is whether Vanta is ready for the future I've already built."
