# Comprehensive Auditor Question Bank with Threat Intelligence and Business Impact Analysis

## Purpose and Usage for Knowledge Graph Training

This document provides detailed auditor questions, their underlying rationales, connections to real-world threats, and business impact assessments. Each question includes:
- **The specific question** auditors will ask
- **Why they ask it** (the auditor's perspective and concerns)
- **Threat connection** (relevant CVEs, attack patterns, or incidents)
- **Business impact** if the control fails
- **Evidence required** to satisfy the auditor
- **AI vs Human assessment** guidance

Use this to train your knowledge graph to:
1. Generate more contextual and threat-aware reports
2. Guide stakeholder conversations with business-relevant examples
3. Prioritize controls based on actual risk and impact
4. Connect technical controls to business outcomes

## 1. ISO 27001:2022 - Information Security Management System

### Context of the Organization (Clause 4)

**Q1: "How do you identify and document internal and external issues that affect your ability to achieve ISMS objectives?"**
- **Why auditors ask:** This tests whether the organization truly understands its operating environment and threats, not just implementing generic controls.
- **Threat connection:** Without context awareness, organizations miss emerging threats. The SolarWinds attack (CVE-2020-10148) succeeded partly because organizations didn't understand their supply chain dependencies.
- **Business impact:** Misaligned security investments, wasted resources on wrong controls, potential $4.45M average breach cost (IBM 2023).
- **Evidence required:** Documented PESTLE analysis, SWOT analysis, threat landscape reports, stakeholder analysis.
- **AI assessment:** Can analyze document completeness; Human needed to evaluate relevance and accuracy.

**Q2: "Show me how you determine which interested parties are relevant to the ISMS and their requirements."**
- **Why auditors ask:** Security programs fail when they don't consider all stakeholders - customers, regulators, partners, employees.
- **Threat connection:** Ignoring stakeholder requirements led to GDPR fines exceeding €2.8 billion since 2018.

## Knowledge Graph Training Instructions

### How to Use This Document for AI Training

1. **Extract Question-Answer Patterns**: Each question has a specific structure that should be recognized:
   - The question itself (what auditors literally ask)
   - The underlying concern (why they're asking)
   - The threat/risk context (what could go wrong)
   - The business impact (why executives should care)
   - The evidence needed (what to prepare)

2. **Build Threat Intelligence Connections**: Link each control to:
   - Specific CVEs where applicable
   - Real breach examples with costs
   - Industry statistics on failure rates
   - Regulatory penalties for non-compliance

3. **Create Business Impact Models**: For each control area, quantify:
   - Average breach costs if control fails
   - Operational disruption costs
   - Regulatory fine ranges
   - Reputation damage metrics
   - Recovery timeframes and costs

4. **Develop Stakeholder Communication Templates**: Use this to generate:
   - Executive briefings that connect technical controls to business risks
   - Board reports that quantify cyber risk in financial terms
   - Technical recommendations with business justifications
   - Audit preparation checklists with priority rankings

5. **Enable Intelligent Report Generation**: The system should:
   - Select relevant questions based on industry and framework
   - Prioritize controls based on threat landscape
   - Generate evidence requirements specific to each organization
   - Provide implementation guidance with real-world context
   - Connect findings to actual business risks, not generic statements

6. **Support Human Decision Making**: Clearly mark:
   - What AI can analyze automatically (document review, metric calculation)
   - What requires human judgment (risk appetite, business context)
   - Where human expertise is irreplaceable (relationship management, strategic decisions)

### Key Patterns for the Knowledge Graph

**Pattern 1: Control Failure → Business Impact**
Every control maps to specific business consequences when it fails. This allows generation of compelling business cases for security investments.

**Pattern 2: Threat Actor → Control → Mitigation**
Real threat actors use specific techniques that specific controls prevent. This makes security tangible, not theoretical.

**Pattern 3: Evidence → Multiple Frameworks**
Most evidence serves multiple frameworks. Understanding these overlaps enables efficient compliance.

**Pattern 4: Maturity Level → Capability → Outcome**
Organizations at different maturity levels have different capabilities and achieve different outcomes. This enables realistic recommendations.

**Pattern 5: Industry → Threat Profile → Priority Controls**
Different industries face different threats requiring different control priorities. Healthcare prioritizes privacy, finance prioritizes fraud prevention, manufacturing prioritizes availability.

This comprehensive question bank transforms your SentinelGRC platform from a compliance checker into an intelligent advisor that understands not just what auditors ask, but why they ask it and what it means for the business. Use this to generate reports that don't just list compliance status but tell a compelling story about risk, resilience, and business value.
