# PROFESSIONAL ISMS REPORT REQUIREMENTS
**Target:** Generate audit-firm quality ISMS reports  
**Standard:** Match Big 4 consulting firm deliverables  
**Date:** August 17, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD ANALYSIS**

Based on comparison with GRC Mastery professional documents, our reports lack:

1. **Detailed Control Mapping:**
   - Missing specific ISO control references (A.5.9, A.5.10, etc.)
   - No evidence citations with document page numbers
   - Generic recommendations instead of specific procedures

2. **Professional Structure:**
   - Missing roles and responsibilities matrices
   - No detailed implementation procedures
