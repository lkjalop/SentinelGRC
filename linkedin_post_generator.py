FROM UBER DRIVER TO ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ARCHITECT

While driving Uber to support my family, I built an enterprise compliance platform that addresses a $44B market gap. Here's what I learned:

THE PROJECT: Sentinel GRC
- 8 compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, Essential Eight)
- Framework conflict detection (industry first!)
- 62MB memory footprint (optimized from 113MB)
- 30-day deployment vs 6 months for competitors

KEY INSIGHT: Found that NO existing platform detects when different compliance frameworks conflict with each other. This causes expensive audit failures.

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Hybrid intelligence mesh architecture
- CI/CD compliance gates for DevSecOps
- Real-time conflict detection algorithms
- Professional PDF report generation
- Thread-safe caching with bounded collections

BUSINESS VALIDATION:
- Analyzed $44B market growing to $160B by 2033
- Identified pricing gaps in competitor solutions
- Designed three-tier monetization strategy
- Created acquisition targets and partnership models

WHAT THIS PROVES:
Building enterprise software requires strategic thinking, not just coding. Understanding market dynamics, competitive positioning, and business models matters more than years of experience.

NEXT STEPS:
Looking for DevSecOps, GRC, or Security Architecture roles where I can apply this strategic thinking. Also open to discussing the platform with potential buyers or partners.

P.S. - Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unexpected places. If you're hiring based on potential rather than pedigree, let's talk.
