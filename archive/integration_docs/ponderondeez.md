Architectural Brief for Claude Code: Compliance Mesh Pipeline Integration & Modularization Strategy
Executive Context
Current State: 16,000 lines of monolithic code combining compliance assessment and DevSecOps functionality
Target State: Modular, scalable architecture supporting enterprise deployment
Constraint: Zero budget, single developer, must maintain working system during refactor
Philosophy: Augment human expertise, not replace it (GRC professionals remain essential)
Strategic Questions for Consideration
1. Codebase Separation Decision
Should we maintain a single repository or split into specialized services?
Option A: Single Repository, Multiple Services

ArgusAI: Unified platform with modular services
Pros: Easier dependency management, single deployment pipeline
Cons: Potential for coupling, harder to scale teams independently

Option B: Separated Repositories

ArgusAI: CI/CD compliance mesh, shift-left focus
SentinelGRC: Traditional GRC platform, expert empowerment
Pros: Clear separation of concerns, independent scaling
Cons: Complex inter-service communication, deployment orchestration

Option C: Monorepo with Published Packages

Use tools like Lerna/Nx for monorepo management
Publish internal packages that can be consumed independently
Pros: Best of both worlds, gradual migration path
Cons: Initial setup complexity

Questions for Claude Code to Consider

What's the current test coverage? (Affects refactoring risk)
Are there any hard real-time requirements? (Affects architecture choice)
What's the expected growth rate? (Affects scaling strategy)
Which frameworks are most commonly used? (Affects optimization priorities)
What's the current deployment environment? (Affects technology choices)

Note for Claude Code: This is a collaborative architecture discussion, not a directive. Please evaluate these options based on the actual codebase structure, identify risks and opportunities we haven't considered, and propose the most pragmatic path forward. The goal is sustainable, scalable architecture that enhances human expertise rather than replacing it.
The ethical consideration is crucial - GRC professionals should see this as a tool that eliminates tedious work so they can focus on strategic risk management and stakeholder relationships. Every architectural decision should support this human-centric approach.
What patterns resonate most with the current codebase structure? What risks do you see that we should address?
