## User Experience Architecture (30% Focus)

### Progressive Disclosure Interface Design

The user journey begins with strategic simplicity that progressively reveals complexity only as needed. This approach reduces cognitive load while maintaining the sophisticated data collection necessary for accurate compliance assessment.

**Initial Contact Flow:**
```
Company Information (30 seconds)
├── Company name and ABN
├── Industry selection (predefined dropdown)
├── Employee count ranges (<50, 50-200, 200-1000, 1000+)
└── Compliance urgency (immediate, 3 months, 6 months, planning)
```

**Stakeholder Identification Intelligence:**
The concierge agent uses company size and industry context to suggest appropriate stakeholders rather than requiring users to understand complex compliance roles. For a 100-person technology company, it automatically suggests IT Manager, Legal/Privacy Officer, and Executive Sponsor. For a 500-person healthcare organization, it expands to include CISO, Compliance Officer, and Operations Director.

**Asynchronous Data Collection Strategy:**
Recognizing that compliance assessment requires input from multiple busy stakeholders, the system implements intelligent asynchronous coordination. Each stakeholder receives role-specific questions optimized for their expertise and time constraints. IT managers receive technical architecture questions, legal teams receive policy and procedure inquiries, and executives receive risk appetite and budget authorization requests.

**Document Upload and Processing:**
Users can upload existing documentation including network diagrams, policy documents, previous audit reports, and security assessments. The system uses intelligent document parsing to extract relevant information and populate preliminary assessments, reducing manual data entry requirements.

```

The system automatically detects conflicts between stakeholder responses and flags them for resolution before proceeding to agent analysis. This prevents downstream issues where compliance agents receive contradictory information and generate inconsistent recommendations.

## Technical Architecture (45% Focus)

### Multi-Agent Orchestration System

Building on the proven CrewAI framework from the career intelligence platform, the agent architecture implements specialized compliance expertise with collaborative reasoning capabilities.

**Agent Specialization Matrix:**

**Essential 8 Agent:**
- Expertise Domain: ACSC Essential 8 Maturity Levels 1-3
- Knowledge Sources: cyber.gov.au publications, ISM guidelines, ACSC threat reports
- Assessment Capabilities: Control implementation analysis, maturity scoring, gap identification
- Output Formats: Executive summary, technical implementation roadmap, cost estimates

**ISO 27001 Agent:**
- Expertise Domain: ISO 27001:2022 114 controls across 14 categories
- Knowledge Sources: ISO standards documentation, audit frameworks, certification guides
- Assessment Capabilities: Control mapping, evidence requirements, ISMS readiness
- Output Formats: Control matrix, audit preparation checklist, certification roadmap

**Privacy Act Agent:**
- Expertise Domain: Privacy Act 1988, Notifiable Data Breaches scheme, Australian Privacy Principles
- Knowledge Sources: OAIC guidance, privacy impact assessment templates, breach case studies
- Assessment Capabilities: Data flow analysis, consent mechanisms, breach risk assessment
- Output Formats: Privacy impact assessment, data governance recommendations, breach response procedures

**AI Governance Agent (ISO 42001):**
- Expertise Domain: AI management systems, algorithmic accountability, AI ethics frameworks
- Knowledge Sources: ISO 42001:2023, Australian AI Ethics Framework, industry best practices
- Assessment Capabilities: AI risk assessment, governance framework evaluation, ethical AI implementation
- Output Formats: AI governance roadmap, risk mitigation strategies, ethical compliance matrix

### Collaborative Reasoning Engine

The multi-agent system implements sophisticated collaboration patterns that go beyond simple parallel processing. Agents engage in structured debate about conflicting requirements, negotiate trade-offs between frameworks, and develop unified recommendations that address overlapping compliance domains.

**Agent Interaction Patterns:**

**Consensus Building:** When multiple frameworks address the same business risk (such as access control), agents negotiate unified recommendations that satisfy all applicable requirements while minimizing implementation complexity.

**Conflict Resolution:** The system identifies situations where compliance frameworks conflict (such as data residency requirements versus cloud adoption) and escalates these decisions to human stakeholders with clear trade-off analysis.

**Gap Analysis Collaboration:** Agents cross-reference their assessments to identify gaps that might be missed by single-framework analysis, such as Essential 8 controls that support ISO 27001 certification objectives.

**Cost Optimization:** The collaborative engine prioritizes recommendations based on cost-benefit analysis, identifying high-impact low-cost improvements that address multiple compliance requirements simultaneously.

### Knowledge Graph Architecture

The knowledge representation system uses Neo4j to model complex relationships between compliance requirements, business assets, threat vectors, and legal obligations. This graph-based approach enables sophisticated reasoning about compliance interdependencies that traditional relational databases cannot support effectively.

**Node Types and Relationships:**

```cypher
// Core node types representing compliance domain entities
CREATE (c:ComplianceControl {
  framework: "Essential8",
  control_id: "E8.1",
  maturity_level: 2,
  description: "Application Control Implementation"
})

CREATE (t:ThreatVector {
  mitre_id: "T1566.001",
  technique: "Spearphishing Attachment",
  severity: "High"
})

CREATE (b:BusinessAsset {
  type: "Email System",
  criticality: "High",
  data_classification: "Sensitive"
})

CREATE (l:LegalRequirement {
  act: "Privacy Act 1988",
  section: "APP 11",
  description: "Security of personal information"
})

// Relationships enabling intelligent reasoning
CREATE (c)-[:MITIGATES]->(t)
CREATE (c)-[:PROTECTS]->(b)
CREATE (l)-[:REQUIRES]->(c)
CREATE (t)-[:TARGETS]->(b)
```

This graph structure enables agents to reason about complex scenarios such as "What Essential 8 controls are required to satisfy Privacy Act obligations for our email system, and how do these relate to current threat vectors targeting similar organizations?"

### Database Architecture Strategy

The system implements a polyglot persistence approach that optimizes different data types for their specific access patterns and consistency requirements.

**PostgreSQL (Operational Data):**
- User accounts and authentication
- Assessment history and audit trails
- Stakeholder communications and scheduling
- Billing and subscription management

**Neo4j (Knowledge Graph):**
- Compliance framework relationships
- Threat intelligence mappings
- Business asset interdependencies
- Legal requirement connections

**ChromaDB (Vector Storage):**
- Document embeddings for semantic search
- Compliance framework content
- Uploaded documentation analysis
- Conversation history embeddings

**Redis (Caching and Sessions):**
- Agent conversation state
- Assessment progress tracking
- Real-time collaboration data
- Performance optimization caching

### Security Architecture Implementation

Security represents a foundational concern given the sensitive nature of compliance data and the regulatory requirements governing its handling. The architecture implements defense-in-depth strategies with zero-trust principles applied throughout the system.

**Authentication and Authorization:**
- Multi-factor authentication required for all users
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- API key rotation for service-to-service communication
- Session management with automatic timeout and suspicious activity detection

**Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest using AES-256 for all databases
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Field-level encryption for sensitive compliance data
- Automatic data retention and deletion policies

**Network Security:**
- Private network segmentation for database and agent services
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection through Cloudflare
- DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Geographic access restrictions based on business requirements

**Audit and Compliance:**
- Comprehensive audit logging of all system activities
- Immutable audit trails with cryptographic integrity
- Automated compliance monitoring and alerting
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

```

**Resource Allocation Strategy:**

The Oracle Cloud Always Free tier provides 4 ARM-based virtual machines with a total of 24GB RAM and 200GB storage. This allocation supports the multi-agent architecture while maintaining separation of concerns and security boundaries.

**VM 1 (Agent Orchestration):** Hosts the CrewAI framework and agent coordination logic along with Ollama for local language model inference. This separation ensures that core agent processing has dedicated resources and can scale independently.

**VM 2 (Document Processing):** Dedicated to document parsing, OCR processing, and vector embedding generation using ChromaDB. This compute-intensive workload benefits from isolated resources and can be scaled during high document processing periods.

**VM 3 (Sidecar Services):** Hosts the legal review agent and adversarial threat modeling services. These premium features run independently to avoid impacting core compliance assessment performance.

**VM 4 (Database Cluster):** Manages all persistent data storage including PostgreSQL for operational data, Neo4j for the knowledge graph, and Redis for caching and session management.

### Terraform Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure deployment implements GitOps principles with infrastructure as code practices that demonstrate enterprise-level operational maturity.

```hcl
# terraform/environments/prod/main.tf
# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure configuration for production deployment

terraform {
  required_providers {
    oci = {
      source  = "oracle/oci"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "sentinel-grc"
    workspaces {
      name = "production"
    }
  }
}

# Virtual Cloud Network with security-first design
resource "oci_core_vcn" "sentinel_vcn" {
  compartment_id = var.compartment_id
  cidr_blocks    = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  display_name   = "sentinel-grc-vcn"
  dns_label      = "sentinelgrc"
  
  freeform_tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Project     = "sentinel-grc"
    Owner       = "kevin.jalop"
  }
}

# Private subnet for database and internal services
resource "oci_core_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  compartment_id = var.compartment_id
  vcn_id         = oci_core_vcn.sentinel_vcn.id
  cidr_block     = "10.0.1.0/24"
  display_name   = "sentinel-private-subnet"
  
  prohibit_public_ip_on_vnic = true
  route_table_id             = oci_core_route_table.private_route_table.id
  security_list_ids          = [oci_core_security_list.private_security_list.id]
}

# Public subnet for application services
resource "oci_core_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  compartment_id = var.compartment_id
  vcn_id         = oci_core_vcn.sentinel_vcn.id
  cidr_block     = "10.0.2.0/24"
  display_name   = "sentinel-public-subnet"
  
  route_table_id    = oci_core_route_table.public_route_table.id
  security_list_ids = [oci_core_security_list.public_security_list.id]
}
```

The Terraform configuration implements network segmentation with private subnets for sensitive database operations and public subnets for application services that require internet access. Security groups restrict traffic flow according to the principle of least privilege.

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

The deployment pipeline implements automated testing, security scanning, and staged deployment practices that demonstrate DevOps maturity and reduce operational risk.

        run: |
          # Blue-green deployment with zero downtime
          ./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

The pipeline implements security scanning, infrastructure planning, and staged deployment with automated testing at each stage. This approach reduces deployment risk while maintaining rapid iteration capability.

**Adversarial Analysis Capabilities:**

**Attack Chain Modeling:** The agent constructs detailed attack scenarios that exploit specific control gaps identified in the compliance assessment. For example, if Essential 8 application control is not implemented, it models spear-phishing attacks followed by malware execution and lateral movement.

**Business Impact Calculation:** Each attack scenario includes quantified business impact estimates including downtime costs, data breach penalties, regulatory fines, and reputation damage. This enables informed risk-based decision making about control implementation priorities.

**Compensating Control Analysis:** When recommended controls cannot be implemented immediately, the agent suggests compensating controls that reduce attack likelihood or impact while permanent solutions are developed.

**Penetration Testing Roadmap:** The agent provides specific guidance for penetration testers about which vulnerabilities to prioritize and which attack techniques are most likely to succeed given the current control environment.

### Insurance Integration and Breach Response

The sidecar architecture includes automated integration with cyber insurance providers and breach response procedures that provide immediate value during security incidents.

**Insurance Provider Integration:**

**Automated Risk Reporting:** The system can automatically generate and submit risk assessment reports to cyber insurance providers in their required formats, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring accurate risk representation.

**Continuous Monitoring Updates:** As compliance posture changes through control implementation or environmental changes, the system provides automated updates to insurers demonstrating ongoing risk management efforts.

**Breach Notification Automation:** In the event of a security incident, the system can automatically generate initial breach notifications to relevant authorities (OAIC, ACSC, industry regulators) while preserving legal privilege for detailed investigation findings.

**Premium Optimization Recommendations:** By analyzing the relationship between specific control implementations and insurance premium discounts, the system provides data-driven recommendations for cost-effective security investments.

**Breach Response Orchestration:**

**Incident Classification:** The system provides automated incident classification based on data types involved, potential impact scope, and regulatory notification requirements.

**Response Timeline Management:** Automated tracking of regulatory notification deadlines (OAIC 72-hour breach notification, ACSC voluntary reporting) with escalation alerts for approaching deadlines.

**Evidence Preservation:** Guidance for preserving digital evidence while maintaining business continuity, including recommendations for forensic service providers and legal counsel specializing in cyber incidents.

**Stakeholder Communication Templates:** Pre-approved communication templates for different stakeholder groups (customers, employees, media, regulators) that can be customized based on incident specifics while maintaining legal privilege protections.
