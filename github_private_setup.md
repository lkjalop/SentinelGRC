```

### Via Web Interface:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Danger Zone" 
4. Click "Change repository visibility"
5. Select "Make private"
6. Type repository name to confirm

## Security Considerations

### Access Control:
- Keep repository PRIVATE until strategic decisions made
- Only add collaborators you trust completely
- Use GitHub's branch protection for main branch
- Enable two-factor authentication on GitHub account

### IP Protection:
- All commits timestamped (establishes creation dates)
- LICENSE file protects proprietary rights
- INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md documents novel concepts
- Regular commits show iterative development

## Next Steps After Private Setup

1. ‚úÖ Repository created and secured
2. üìû Schedule mentor calls with Michael Gibbs & David Linthicum  
3. ü§ù Discuss with American colleague (under NDA if needed)
4. üìä Prepare strategic partnership analysis
5. üéØ Evaluate partnership/acquisition opportunities
